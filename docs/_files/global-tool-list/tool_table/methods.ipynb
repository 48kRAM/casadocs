    "default) or as a single array. In the latter case one axis in the shape\n",

    "or in a separate header file (named by the argument headerfile). In both\n",

    "columns. These names may be enclosed in quotes (either single or\n",
    "double). \\\\item The second line contains the data type and optionally\n",
    "the shape of each column. Valid types are: \\\\begin{itemize} \\\\item S for\n",
    "Short data \\\\item I for Integer data \\\\item R for Real data \\\\item D for\n",
    "Double Precision data \\\\item X for Complex data (Real followed by\n",
    "Imaginary) \\\\item Z for Complex data (Amplitude then Phase) \\\\item DX\n",
    "for Double Precision Complex data (Real followed by Imaginary) \\\\item DZ\n",
    "for Double Precision Complex data (Amplitude then Phase) \\\\item A for\n",
    "ASCII data (a value must be enclosed in single or double quotes if it\n",
    "contains whitespace) \\\\item B for Boolean data (False are empty string,\n",
    "0, or any string starting with F, f, N, or n). \\\\end{itemize}\n",
    "\\\\end{enumerate} If a column is an array, the shape has to be given\n",
    "after the data type without any whitespace. E.g. \\\\texttt{I10} defines\n",
    "an integer vector of length 10. \\\\texttt{A2,5} defines a 2-dim string\n",
    "array with shape \\[2,5\\]. Note that \\\\texttt{I} is not the same as\n",
    "\\\\texttt{I1} as the first one defines a scalar and the other one a\n",
    "vector with length 1. The last column can have one variable length axis\n",
    "denoted by the value 0. It \"consumes\" the remainder of the input line.\n",
    "If the argument headerfile is set then the header information is read\n",
    "from that file instead of the first lines of the data file. To give a\n",
    "simple example of the form where the header information is located at\n",

    "\\\\\\\\Also note that an empty string can be given. Let us now give an\n",
    "example of a separate header file that one might use to get\n",
    "interferometer data into \\\\casa: \\\\begin{verbatim} U V W TIME ANT1 ANT2\n",

    "\\\\end{verbatim} Note that the DATA column is defined as a 2-dim array of\n",
    "1 correlation and a variable number of channels, so the actual number of\n",
    "channels is determined by the input. In this example both rows will have\n",
    "1 channel (note that a complex value contains 2 values). Tables may have\n",
    "keywords in addition to the columns. The keywords are useful for holding\n",
    "information that is global to the entire table (such as author,\n",
    "revision, history, {\\\\em etc,}). \\\\\\\\The keywords in the header\n",
    "definitions must preceed the column descriptions. They must be enclosed\n",
    "between a line that starts with \".key...\" and a line that starts with\n",
    "\".endkey...\" (where ... can be anything). Between these two lines each\n",
    "line should contain the following as listed below. A table keywordset\n",
    "and column keywordsets can be specified. The latter can be specified by\n",
    "specifying the column name after the .keywords string. \\\\begin{itemize}\n",
    "\\\\item The keyword name, e.g., ANYKEY \\\\item The datatype and optional\n",
    "shape of the keyword (cf. list of valid types above) \\\\item The value or\n",
    "values for the keyword (the keyword may contain a scalar or an array of\n",
    "values). e.g., 3.14159 21.78945 \\\\end{itemize} Thus to continue the\n",
    "example above, one might wish to add keywords as follows:\n",
    "\\\\begin{verbatim} .keywords DATE A \"97/1/16\" REVISION D 2.01 AUTHOR A\n",
    "\"Tim Cornwell\" INSTRUMENT A \"VLA\" .endkeywords .keywords TIME UNIT A \"s\"\n",
    ".endkeywords U V W TIME ANT1 ANT2 DATA R R R D I I X1,0 \\\\end{verbatim}\n",
    "Similarly to the column format string, the keyword formats can also\n",
    "contain shape information. The only difference is that if no shape is\n",
    "given, a keyword can have multiple values (making it a vector). It is\n",
    "possible to ignore comment lines in the header and data file by giving\n",
    "the \\\\texttt{commentmarker}. It indicates that lines starting with the\n",
    "given marker are ignored. Note that the marker can be a regular\n",
    "expression (e.g. texttt{' \\*//'} tells that lines starting with // and\n",
    "optionally preceeded by blanks have to be ignored). With the arguments\n",
    "\\\\texttt{firstline} and \\\\texttt{lastline} one can specify which lines\n",
    "have to be taken from the input file. A negative value means 1 for\n",
    "\\\\texttt{firstline} or end-of-file for \\\\texttt{lastline}. Note that if\n",
    "the headers and data are combined in one file, these line arguments\n",
    "apply to the whole file. If headers and data are in separate files,\n",
    "these line arguments apply to the data file only. Also note that ignored\n",
