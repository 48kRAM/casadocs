    "constructor **ms**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the most commonly used constructor. It creates an ms tool which\n",
    "is attached to the specified measurement set table. By default the table\n",
    "is opened read only to prevent you from accidently making changes to the\n",
    "measurement set. Set nomodify to False you you do intend to make\n",
    "changes. Setting the lock argument to True will permanently lock the\n",
    "table preventing other processes from writing to the measurement set.\n",
    "Unless you expect this to happen, and want to prevent it, you should\n",
    "leave the lock argument at the default value which implies auto-locking.\n",
    "The host argument specifies which machine the precompiled ms process\n",
    "should be started on. The default value starts it on the same machine as\n",
    "the one that casapy is running on. In order to run the ms tool on a\n",
    "remote machine you need to satisfy all the following conditions.\n",
    "\\\\begin{itemize} \\\\item It must be possible to start casa on the remote\n",
    "machine \\\\item You must be able to log onto the remote machine without\n",
    "having to type a password \\\\item The CASAPATH environment variable must\n",
    "be defined on the remote machine. You may want to set this up in the\n",
    "relevant \\`\\`dot'' file eg., adding a line like\n",
    "\\\\texttt{source\\~/usr/local/aips++/aipsinit.csh} in your .cshrc file\n",
    "(for csh). \\\\end{itemize} One quick way to check if all three conditions\n",
    "are met is to type, on your local machine (rsh host 'echo\n",
    "\\\\\\\\\\$CASAPATH') where host is replaced by the name of the remote\n",
    "machine. If the value of the CASAPATH variable that is printed does not\n",
    "contain something like {aips-root\\~architecture\\~site\\~host} and that\n",
    "all the values are correct for the remote machine you can be certain\n",
    "that starting the ms tool, or any casa server, on the remote host will\n",
    "not work. Each ms tool can only run one function at a time. To solve\n",
    "this you start two servers. The forcenewserver argument allows you to do\n",
    "this by overriding the default behaviour of having each ms tool share\n",

    "'u', 'v', 'w', 'uvdist', and 'weight'. Unrecognized items will result in\n",
    "a warning being sent to the logger. Corrected, model, and float\n",
    "visibilities will result in a warning if these columns do not exist.\n",
    "Duplicate items are silently ignored. Note that 'ha', 'last', and 'ut'\n",

    "the key in uppercase. For example, for 'ut', the data is found in:\n",
    "rec\\['axis_info'\\]\\['time_axis'\\]\\['UT'\\]. See more information about\n",
    "'axis_info' below. The record that is returned contains fields that\n",
    "correspond to each of the specified items. Most fields will contain an\n",
    "array. The array may be one, two or three dimensional depending on\n",
    "whether the corresponding row in the measurement set is a scalar, one-,\n",
    "or two-dimensional. Unless the ifraxis argument is set to True, the\n",
    "length of the last axis on these arrays will correspond to the number of\n",
    "rows in the selected measurement set. If the ifraxis argument is set to\n",
    "True, the row axis is split into an interferometer axis and a time axis.\n",
    "For example, a measurement set with 90 rows, in an array with 6\n",
    "telescopes (so that there are 15 interferometers), may have a data array\n",
    "of shape \\[4,32,90\\] if ifraxis is False, or \\[4,32,15,6\\] if ifraxis is\n",
    "True (assuming there are 4 correlations and 32 channels). If there are\n",
    "missing rows, as will happen if not all interferometers were used for\n",
    "all time-slots, then a default value will be inserted. This splitting of\n",
    "the row axis may not happen for items where there is only a single value\n",
    "per row. For some items the returned vector will contain only as many\n",
    "values as there are interferometers and it is implicit that the same\n",
    "value should be used for all time slots. The antenna1, antenna2, feed1,\n",
    "feed2 and ifr_number items fall in this category. For other items, the\n",
    "returned vector will have as many values as there are time slots and it\n",
    "is implicit that the same value should be used for all interferometers.\n",
    "The field_id, scan_number, data_desc_id, and time items fall into this\n",
    "category. The 'axis_info' item provides data labelling information. It\n",
    "returns a record with the following fields: corr_axis, freq_axis,\n",
    "ifr_axis, and time_axis. The latter two fields are not present if\n",
    "ifraxis is set to False. 1. The corr_axis field contains a string vector\n",
    "with elements like 'RR' or 'XY' that indicates which polarizations were\n",
    "correlated together to produce the data. The length of this vector will\n",
    "always be the same as the length of the first axis of the data array. 2.\n",
    "The freq_axis field contains a record with two fields, chan_freq and\n",
    "resolution. Each of these fields contains vectors which indicate the\n",
    "centre frequency and spectral resolution (FWHM) of each channel. The\n",
    "length of these vectors will be the same as the length of the second\n",
    "axis in the data. 3. The ifr_axis field contains fields: ifr_number,\n",
    "ifr_name, ifr_shortname and baseline. The ifr_number is the same as\n",
    "returned by the 'ifr_number' item, 1000\\*antenna1+antenna2. The ifr_name\n",
    "and ifr_shortname are string vectors containing descriptions of the\n",
    "interferometer; ifr_name contains the names of the antenna pair\n",
    "separated by a hyphen, and ifr_shortname contains the ids of the antenna\n",
    "pair separated by a hyphen. The baseline is the Euclidian distance in\n",
    "meters between the two antennas. All of these vectors have a length\n",
    "equal to the number of interferometers in the selected measurement set,\n",
    "i.e., to the length of the third axis in the data when ifraxis is True.\n",
    "4. The time_axis field contains the MJD seconds field and optionally the\n",
    "HA, UT, and LAST fields. To include the optional fields, you need to add\n",
    "'ha', 'last' or 'ut' strings to the list of requested items. All of the\n",
    "fields in the time_axis record contain vectors that indicate the time at\n",
    "the midpoint of the observation and are in seconds. The MJD seconds\n",
    "field is since 0 hours on the day having a modified julian day number of\n",
    "zero and the rest are since midnight prior to the start of the\n",
    "observation. An optional gap size can be specified to visually separate\n",
    "groups of interferometers with the same antenna1 index (handy for\n",
    "identifying antennas in an interferometer vs time display). The default\n",
    "is no gap. An optional increment can be specified to return data from\n",
    "every row matching the increment only. When the average flag is set, the\n",
    "data will be averaged over the time axis if the ifraxis is True or the\n",
    "row axis i.e., different interferometers and times may be averaged\n",
    "together. In the latter case, some of the coordinate information, like\n",
    "antenna_id, will no longer make sense. When all data to be averaged is\n",
    "unflagged, the result is the averaged value and the corresponding flag\n",
    "is False. When all data is flagged, the result is set to zero and the\n",
    "corresponding flag is True. When data to be averaged is mixed (unflagged\n",
    "and flagged), only the unflagged values are averaged and the flag is set\n",
    "to False. You need to call selectinit before calling this function. If\n",
    "you haven't then selectinit will be called for you with default\n",
    "arguments. Items prefixed with corrected, model, residual or\n",

    "WEIGHT and WEIGHT_SPECTRUM columns are not updated and values in the\n",
    "SIGMA and SIGMA_SPECTRUM are set to 1/sqrt(of the newly computed\n",
    "weight). If a weight value is 0, the corresponding sigma value is -1. In\n",
    "this case, you should either split out the DATA column and run statwt,\n",
    "or run with datacolumn='corrected' or 'residual' to update\n",
    "WEIGHT/WEIGHT_SPECTRUM. Otherwise the data are internally not\n",
    "consistent. TIME BINNING One of two algorithms can be used for time\n",
    "binning. If slidetimebin=True, then a sliding time bin of the specified\n",
    "width is used. If slidetimebin=False, then block time processing is\n",
    "used. The sliding time bin algorithm will generally be both more memory\n",
    "intensive and take longer than the block processing algorithm. Each\n",
    "algorithm is discussed in detail below. If the value of timebin is an\n",
    "integer, this value represents the number of contiguous, unique time\n",
    "stamps (from the MS TIME column) that should be used for averaging.\n",
    "Block Time Processing The data are processed in contiguous time blocks\n",
    "in this case. This means that all WEIGHT_SPECTRUM values will be set to\n",
    "the same value for all data within the same time bin/channel\n",
    "bin/correlation bin (see the section on channel binning and description\n",
    "of combine=\"corr\" for more details on channel binning and correlation\n",
    "binning). If timebin is specified as a time quantity (eg, '110s'), then\n",
    "the time bins are not necessarily contiguous and are not necessarily the\n",
    "same width. The start of a bin is always coincident with a value from\n",
    "the TIME column, So for example, if values from the TIME column are\n",
    "\\[20s, 60s, 100s, 140s, 180s, 230s\\], and timebin = 110s, the first bin\n",
    "would start at 20s and run to 130s, so that data from timestamps 20s,\n",
    "60s, and 100s will be included in the first bin. The second bin would\n",
    "start at 140s, so that data for timestamps 140s, 180s, and 230s would be\n",
    "included in the second bin. In the case where timebin is an integer,\n",
    "this denotes the number of contigous timestamps that should be binned\n",
    "together. Note that, in this case, for rows \"left over\" in the upper\n",
    "edge of the bin, their values are computed using timebin that would\n",
    "include rows with times earlier than them. For example, in an MS with 8\n",
    "rows in one block to be processed and timebin=3, timestamps 1, 2, and 3\n",
    "would be used to compute the weights of the first three three rows, and\n",
    "rows 4, 5, and 6 would be used to compute weights for the next three\n",
    "rows as expected. Rows 7 and 8 are \"left over\" rows, but three rows (as\n",
    "per the integer timebin specification) are still used to compute them.\n",
    "Row 7 and 8 weights are computed by combining data in rows 6, 7, and 8.\n",
    "Sliding Time Window Processing In the sliding time window case, in the\n",
    "case where timebin is a time quantity, the time window is always\n",
    "centered on the timestamp of the row in question and extends\n",
    "+/-timebin/2 around that timestamp, subject the the time block\n",
    "boundaries. In the case where timebin is an integer, there are two cases\n",
    "to consider: timebin is odd: In this case the target row's data and the\n",
    "data from the +/-(n-1)/2 rows around the target row are also used.\n",
    "timebin is even: In this case, the target row's data and the data from\n",
    "the n/2 rows after the target row and the n/2 - 1 rows before the target\n",
    "row are used. When timebin is an int, for \"edge\" rows, the timebin\n",
    "extends from the edge of the block to the corresponding timebin value of\n",
    "rows away from the edge, so that the timebin is not symmetrical around\n",
    "the target rows, but includes the number of rows specified by the\n",
    "timebin value. OVERRIDING DEFAULT BLOCK BOUNDARIES Rows with the same\n",
    "baselines and data description IDs which are included in that window are\n",
    "used for determining the weight of that row. The boundaries of the time\n",
    "block to which the window is restricted are determined by changes in\n",
    "FIELD_ID, ARRAY_ID, and SCAN_NUMBER. One can override this behavior for\n",
    "FIELD_ID and/or SCAN_NUMBER by specifying the combine parameter (see\n",
    "below). Unlike the time block processing algorithm, this sliding time\n",
    "window algorithm requires that details of all rows for the time window\n",
    "in question are kept in memory, and thus the sliding window algorithm in\n",
    "general and the block processing row when timebin is an int, requires\n",
    "more memory than the block processing method when timebin is a quantity.\n",
    "Also, unlike the block processing method which computes a single value\n",
    "for all weights within a single bin, the sliding window method requires\n",
    "that each row (along with each channel and correlation bin) be processed\n",
    "individually, so in general the sliding window method will take longer\n",
    "than the block processing method. CHANNEL BINNING The width of channel\n",
    "bins is specified via the chanbin parameter. Channel binning occurs\n",
    "within individual spectral windows; bins never span multiple spectral\n",
    "windows. Each channel will be included in exactly one bin. The default\n",
    "value \"spw\" indicates that all channels in each spectral window are to\n",
    "be included in a single bin. Any other string value is interpreted as a\n",
    "quantity, and so should have frequency units, eg \"1MHz\". In this case,\n",
    "the channel frequencies from the CHAN_FREQ column of the SPECTRAL_WINDOW\n",
    "subtable of the MS are used to determine the bins. The first bin starts\n",
    "at the channel frequency of the 0th channel in the spectral window.\n",
    "Channels with frequencies that differ by less than the value specified\n",
    "by the chanbin parameter are included in this bin. The next bin starts\n",
    "at the frequency of the first channel outside the first bin, and the\n",
    "process is repeated until all channels have been binned. If specified as\n",
    "an integer, the value is interpreted as the number of channels to\n",
    "include in each bin. The final bin in the spectral window may not\n",
    "necessarily contain this number of channels. For example, if a spectral\n",
    "window has 15 channels, and chanbin is specified to be 6, then channels\n",
    "0-5 will comprise the first bin, channels 6-11 the second, and channels\n",
    "12-14 the third, so that only three channels will comprise the final\n",
    "bin. MINIMUM REQUIRED NUMBER OF VISIBILITIES The minsamp parameter\n",
    "allows the user to specify the minimum number of unflagged visibilities\n",
    "that must be present in a sample for that sample's weight to be\n",
    "computed. If a sample has less than this number of unflagged points, the\n",
    "associated weights of all the points in the sample are set to zero, and\n",
    "all the points in the sample are flagged. AGGREGATING DATA ACROSS\n",
    "BOUNDARIES By default, data are not aggregated across changes in values\n",
    "in the columns ARRAY_ID, SCAN_NUMBER, STATE_ID, FIELD_ID, and\n",
    "DATA_DESC_ID. One can override this behavior for SCAN_NUMBER, STATE_ID,\n",
    "and FIELD_ID by specifying the combine parameter. For example,\n",
    "specifying combine=\"scan\" will ignore scan boundaries when aggregating\n",
