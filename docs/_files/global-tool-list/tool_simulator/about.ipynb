    "    *sourcename*, *spwname*, *starttime,* and *stoptime*. After this,\n",
    "    you have a MeasurementSet that is complete but *visibilities=0*.\n",
    "2.  In **sm.predict**, you fill a MeasurementSet (either one newly\n",
    "    created or a pre-existing one, perhaps from a real telescope) with\n",

    "    or the **simobserve** task\n",
    "-   The heavy duty columns (*DATA, FLAG*, *IMAGING_WEIGHT*, etc. are\n",
    "    tiled. New tiles are generated for each scan. Thus the TSM files\n",
    "    will not get very large.\n",
