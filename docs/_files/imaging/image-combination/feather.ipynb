In addition, a single dish scaling of 1.2 was applied to adjust calibration differences. The weight functions are shown in yellow (for the low resolution data) and orange (for the high resolution data). The weighting functions were also applied to the green and purple slices. Image slices of the combined, feathered output image are shown in blue. The displays&nbsp;also show the location of the effective dish diameter by the vertical line. This value&nbsp;is kept at the original single dish diameter that is taken from&nbsp;the respective image header. |\n",
