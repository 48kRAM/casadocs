    "CARTA is a new visualization software available to general users who wish to try visualizing image products outside the CASA Viewer.\n",
    "\n",
    "CARTA is the *Cube Analysis and Rendering Tool for Astronomy*, a new image visualization and analysis tool designed for the [ALMA](https://www.almaobservatory.org/en/home/), the [VLA](https://science.nrao.edu/facilities/vla), and the [SKA pathfinders](https://www.skatelescope.org/). As the image size increases drastically with modern telescopes in recent years, viewing an image with a local image viewer or with a remote image viewer via the ssh protocol becomes less efficient. The mission of CARTA is to provide usability and scalability for the future by utilizing modern web technologies and computing parallelization.\\\n",

    "**WARNING: C**ARTA currenly only contains a subset of the functionality that is available in the CASA Viewer. Eventually, CARTA is expected to replace the CASA Viewer as the standard software to visualize ALMA and VLA imaging. However, additional functionality needs to be added to CARTA over the coming cycles before it should be regarded as a replacement for the CASA Viewer.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "Several feature where CARTA v.1.3 is already superior to the CASA Viewer are:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   CARTA shows better performance, especially noticeable when handling large image cubes.\n",
    "-   CARTA launches in a web browser for remote display options.\n",
    "-   CARTA can display Stokes wedges.\n",
    "-   CARTA does not suffer from problems that the CASA Viewer has with properly displaying headers\n",
    "-   CARTA allows users to flexibly modify and safe the layout.\n",
    "-   CARTA supports the HDF5 image format.\n",
    "\n",
    "Subsequent releases of CARTA will continue to enhance CARTA's performance. For a full overview of the current and upcoming features, see the official [CARTA website](https://cartavis.github.io/).\n",
