      CARTA is a new visualization software available to general users
      who wish to try visualizing image products outside the CASA
      Viewer.

      | CARTA is the *Cube Analysis and Rendering Tool for Astronomy*, a
        new image visualization and analysis tool designed for the
        `ALMA <https://www.almaobservatory.org/en/home/>`__, the
        `VLA <https://science.nrao.edu/facilities/vla>`__, and the `SKA
        pathfinders <https://www.skatelescope.org/>`__. As the image
        size increases drastically with modern telescopes in recent
        years, viewing an image with a local image viewer or with a
        remote image viewer via the ssh protocol becomes less efficient.
        The mission of CARTA is to provide usability and scalability for
        the future by utilizing modern web technologies and computing
        parallelization.
      | The official CARTA website and download instructions can be
        found `here <https://cartavis.github.io/>`__.

         **WARNING: C**\ ARTA currenly only contains a subset of the
         functionality that is available in the CASA Viewer. Eventually,
         CARTA is expected to replace the CASA Viewer as the standard
         software to visualize ALMA and VLA imaging. However, additional
         functionality needs to be added to CARTA over the coming cycles
         before it should be regarded as a replacement for the CASA
         Viewer.

      Several feature where CARTA v.1.3 is already superior to the CASA
      Viewer are:

      -  CARTA shows better performance, especially noticeable when
         handling large image cubes.
      -  CARTA launches in a web browser for remote display options.
      -  CARTA can display Stokes wedges.
      -  CARTA does not suffer from problems that the CASA Viewer has
         with properly displaying headers
      -  CARTA allows users to flexibly modify and safe the layout.
      -  CARTA supports the HDF5 image format.

      Subsequent releases of CARTA will continue to enhance CARTAâ€™s
      performance. For a full overview of the current and upcoming
      features, see the official `CARTA
      website <https://cartavis.github.io/>`__.
