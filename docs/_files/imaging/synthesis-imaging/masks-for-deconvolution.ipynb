    "## Creating a **clean** mask:\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several different ways to specify a clean mask, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  A text-based region. The [CASA region text\n",
    "    format](https://casa.nrao.edu/casadocs-devel/stable/imaging/image-analysis/region-file-format)\n",
    "    can be used to define clean regions either by specifying the region\n",
    "    directly in the **tclean** command or by using an ASCII text file\n",
    "    containing the specifications. You can use the viewer to save a\n",
    "    region formatted according to the CRTF specification. To do this, an\n",
    "    image must already exist to serve as a reference or template to\n",
    "    create the mask image or the region.\n",
    "2.  An image consisting of only 1 (valid) and 0 (invalid) pixel values.\n",
    "    Such images can be generated or modified using tasks such as\n",
    "    **makemask**. The mask has to have the same shape (number of pixels,\n",
    "    velocity, and Stokes planes) as the output image. An exception are\n",
    "    single velocity and/or single Stokes plane masks. They will be\n",
    "    expanded to cover all velocity and/or Stokes planes of the output\n",
    "    cube. \n",
    "3.  An automatically generated mask. There are several experimental\n",
    "    algorithms available in **tclean** for automatically masking\n",
    "    emission during the deconvolution cycle. See the [automasking\n",
    "    section](#automasking) below for more details (does not work in the\n",
    "    old **clean** task).\n",
    "4.  A mask created by **tclean** while interactively cleaning using the\n",
    "    viewer. You can combine this method with the options above to create\n",
    "    an initial clean mask and modify it interactively. Please be aware\n",
    "    that when running tclean interactively, the viewer is accessible\n",
    "    during a major cycle, and the mask can be inadvertently by changed\n",
    "    during the active clean cycle, although the new mask is not\n",
    "    registered until the next major cycle. Also note that interactive\n",
    "    **tclean** only works when a region or mask is selected in the CASA\n",
    "    Viewer. If the entire image should be cleaned, please draw a box\n",
    "    around the entire image. There is a known bug that when a region is\n",
    "    first selected, and then de-selected to produce an empty mask\n",
    "    (filled with zeros), the CASA Viewer that runs interactive tclean\n",
