    "## Creating a **clean** mask:\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several different ways to specify a clean mask, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  A text-based region. The [CASA region text format](https://casa.nrao.edu/casadocs-devel/stable/imaging/image-analysis/region-file-format) can be used to define clean regions either by specifying the region directly in the **tclean** command or by using an ASCII text file containing the specifications. You can use the viewer to save a region formatted according to the CRTF specification. To do this, an image must already exist to serve as a reference or template to create the mask image or the region.\n",
    "2.  An image consisting of only 1 (valid) and 0 (invalid) pixel values. Such images can be generated or modified using tasks such as **makemask**. The mask has to have the same shape (number of pixels, velocity, and Stokes planes) as the output image. An exception are single velocity and/or single Stokes plane masks. They will be expanded to cover all velocity and/or Stokes planes of the output cube. \n",
    "3.  An automatically generated mask. There are several experimental algorithms available in **tclean** for automatically masking emission during the deconvolution cycle. See the [automasking section](#automasking) below for more details (does not work in the old **clean** task).\n",
    "4.  A mask created by **tclean** while interactively cleaning using the viewer. You can combine this method with the options above to create an initial clean mask and modify it interactively. Please be aware that when running tclean interactively, the viewer is accessible during a major cycle, and the mask can be inadvertently by changed during the active clean cycle, although the new mask is not registered until the next major cycle. Also note that interactive **tclean** only works when a region or mask is selected in the CASA Viewer. If the entire image should be cleaned, please draw a box around the entire image. There is a known bug that when a region is first selected, and then de-selected to produce an empty mask (filled with zeros), the CASA Viewer that runs interactive tclean will still allow you to proceed, and tclean will detect an empty mask and stop. Please always mark a region/mask to continue interactive tclean, and do not forget to double-click inside the green contours to select the region.\n",
    "\n",
    "However they are created, the masks are all converted (as necessary) and stored as CASA images consisting of the pixel values of 1 and 0. When mask files are read in and have undefined values, these values are treated as 1s by CASA. Mixed types of masks can be specified in the **tclean** task. \n",

One is used for CASA images/image analysis is a T/F mask (pixel mask), which can be embedded in the parent CASA image.  The \\'mask\\' used in imaging normally refers to a 1/0 image, which is directly used to define deconvolution region(s) (or set a \\'clean mask\\') in the **tclean** task.\n",

    "The **tclean** task has an option to generate clean masks automatically during the deconvolution process by applying flux density thresholds to the residual image.

Previously available experimental alogrithms, *\\\"*auto-thresh\\\" and \\\"auto-thresh2\\\" were removed in CASA 5.4. The \\\"auto-multithresh\\\" algorithm can be selected via the *usemask* parameter. For this algorithm, the mask will be updated at the beginning of a minor cycle based on the current residual image. The algorithm uses multiple thresholds based on the noise and sidelobe levels in the residual image to determine what emission to mask. It also have functionality to remove (\\\"prune\\\") small mask regions that are unlikely to be real astronomical emission. A more detailed description of the algorithm are given below and in [\\[1\\]](#Bibliography) .\n",

The parameters *sidelobethreshold* and *noisethreshold* control the initial masking of the image. The *sidelobethreshold* indicates the minimum sidelobe level that should be masked, while the *noisethreshold*  indicates the minimum signal-to-noise value that should be masked. The threshold used for masking is the greater of the two values calculated for each minor cycle based on the rms noise and sidelobe levels in the current residual image. \n",

    "The initial threshold mask can be expanded down to lower signal-to-noise via binary dilation. This feature is particularly useful when there is significant faint extended emission. The *lownoisethreshold* parameter is used to create a mask of the low signal-to-noise emission, which we refer to as the constraint mask. Th previous total positive mask is expanded (or grown) via an operation known as binary dilation, which expands each mask region using a structuring element (also known as a kernel). Currently the structuring element is fixed with a 3x3 matrix with the diagonal element being 0. We use a constraint mask based on a low signal-to-noise threshold to limit the expansion of the mask to regions within the *lownoisethreshold*. Only the regions in the constraint mask that touch the previous mask are retained in the final constraint mask. Then the final constraint mask is pruned, smoothed, and cut using the same method as the initial threshold mask. \n",

This feature assumes that the data has been continuum subtracted. Absorption masking can be turned off by setting the *negativethreshold* vaue to 0 (the default).

    "All the operations described above, including obtaining image statistics, are done per spectral plane for spectral line imaging. If a channel is masked using the noise threshold and the resulting final mask is zero, then future auto-masking iterations will skip that channel. The *minpercentchange* parameter is an experimental parameter that controls whether future masks are calculated for a particular channel if the mask changes by less than n% after major cycle where the cyclethreshold is equal to the threshold for the clean. In general, we recommend *minpercentchange* to be set to -1.0 (turned off).\n",

    "### Noise Estimation \n",
    "\n",
    "Prior to CASA 5.5, \\\"auto-multithresh\\\" estimated the noise per channel using the median absolute deviation (MAD), scaled to match a Gaussian distribution. This noise estimate is computationally fast, but may be less accurate for cases where the emission covers a large fraction (nominally 50%) of the field of view. In CASA 5.5, a new noise estimate was introduced, which uses a more complex and computationally expensive noise estimate. This estimate may yield more accurate estimates of the noise in the case where emission covers a significant fraction of the field of view. The procedure is as follows. If there is no mask, remove pixels from the noise distribution via Chauvenet\\'s criterion [\\[2\\]](#Bibliography)  [\\[3\\]](#Bibliography) and then estimate the noise using the remaining pixels via the median absolute deviation. If there is a mask, then calculate the noise from the pixels outside the clean mask and inside the primary beam mask, which we refer to as the masked MAD. All MAD values are scaled to match a Gaussian distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The parameter fastnoise is set to True by default. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Polarization Data\n",
    "\n",
    "As of CASA 5.6, auto-multithresh now functions with polarization data. It applies the same algorithms to the Stokes QUV images as used for the Stokes I image. This means that the full masking process is applied to the positive emission (including the prune and grow steps), but that the masking of the negative emission only includes the initial threshold mask (no prune or grow).\n",
    "\n",
    "### A Note on Input Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "The default \\\"auto-multithresh\\\" parameters have been optimized for the ALMA 12m array in its more compact configurations. The parameters may need to be modified for other input cases, e.g., ALMA 12m long baseline data, ALMA 7m array data, and  VLA data. The main parameters to explore are *noisethreshold*, *sidelobethreshold*, *lownoisethreshold*, *minbeamfrac*, and *negativethreshold* (if you have absorption). We do not recommend changing the *cutthreshold* and *smoothfactor* parameters from their default values. The *dogrowprune* and *growiterations* parameters are primarily used to improve the speed of the algorithm for large cubes.\n",
