    "    image must already exist to serve as a reference or template to\n",
    "    create the mask image or the region.\n",
    "2.  An image consisting of only 1 (valid) and 0 (invalid) pixel values.\n",
    "    Such images&nbsp;can be generated or modified using tasks such as\n",
    "    **makemask**. The mask has&nbsp;to have the same shape (number of\n",

    "    will be expanded to&nbsp;cover all velocity and/or Stokes planes of\n",
