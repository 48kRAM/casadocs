    "During gridding, N Data channels are binned onto M image channels using several optional interpolation schemes and doppler corrections to transform the data into the LSRK reference frame. When data from multiple channels are mapped to a single image channel, multi-frequency-synthesis gridding is performed within each image channel. More details are explained on the [Spectral Line Imaging](https://casa.nrao.edu/casadocs-devel/stable/imaging/synthesis-imaging/spectral-line-imaging) page. As can be seen from the diagram, parallelization for cube imaging can be naturally done by partitioning data and image planes by frequency for both major and minor cycles.\n",

These Taylor-weighted residual images form the input for the minor cycle of the Multi-Term MFS deconvolution algorithm which performs a linear least squares fit (see [Deconvolution Algorithms](https://casa.nrao.edu/casadocs-devel/stable/imaging/synthesis-imaging/deconvolution-algorithms) section for more information) during deconvolution to obtain Taylor Coefficients per component (to represent sky spectra as polynomials in []{.MathJax_Preview style=\"color: inherit;\"}$I$ vs []{.MathJax_Preview style=\"color: inherit;\"}$\\nu$). This option is accessed via \\\" *specmode=\\'mfs\\'* and *deconvolver*=\\'mtmfs\\', *nterms=2.* \\\" For the same data size as standard MFS (*nterms=1*), Multi-Term MFS will have []{.MathJax_Preview style=\"color: inherit;\"}$N_t$ times the gridding cost and number of images stored in memory.  Parallelization is again done only for the major cycle via data partitioning.\n",

    "Data in the correlation basis are gridded onto separate planes per correlation, imaged, and then transformed into the Stokes basis. A special case for single plane Stokes I is implemented where data from both parallel hands are gridded onto a single uv-grid (to save memory). The point spread function is always taken from the Stokes I gridded weights. Images can be made for all Stokes parameters and correlation pairs (or all combinations possible with the selected data). This is an image-partitioning, where the same data are used to construct the different imaging products. Currently, if any correlation is flagged, all correlations for that datum are considered as flagged. An exception is the \\'*pseudoI*\\' option which allows Stokes I images to include data for which either of the parallel hand data are unflagged.\n",

    "### Multiple Fields\n",
    "\n",
    "A very large field of view can sometimes be imaged as a main field plus a series of (typically) smaller outlier fields. Imaging of fields with relatively few bright outlier sources can benefit from the overal reduction in image size that this option provides.  Instead of gridding the visibilities data onto a giant uv-grid, they are gridded onto multiple smaller images. Each sub-image is then deconvolved via separate minor cycles and their model images combined to predict model visibiliitles to subtract from the data in the next major cycle. The user must specify different phase reference centers for each image field.\n",
    "\n",
    "Different image shapes and gridding and deconvolution algorithms can be chosen for the different outlier fields. For example, one could apply single-plane wideband imaging on the main field, but employ multi-term MFS for an outlier field to account for artificial spectral index due to the wideband primary beam at its location. One can also combine MFS and Cube shapes for different outlier fields, or choose to run Multi-Scale CLEAN on the main field and Hogbom CLEAN on a bright compact outlier.    \n",
    "\n",
    "Overlapping fields are supported when possible (i.e. when the image types are similar enough across outliers) by always picking the \\\"last\\\" instance of that source in the list of outlier images in the order specified by the user. This convention implies that sources in the overlapping area are blanked in the \\\"earlier\\\" model images, such that those sources are not subtracted during the major cycles that clean those images.\n",

The sub images are typically simply subsets of a single large image so that the deconvolution can be performed as a joint image and a single model image is formed. The PSF to be used for deconvolution is picked from the first facet. The list of phase reference centers for all facets is automatically generated from user input of the number of facets (per side) that the image is to be divided into.\n",
