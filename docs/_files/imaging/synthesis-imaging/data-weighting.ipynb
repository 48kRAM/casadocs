    "During imaging, the visibilities can be weighted in different ways to alter the instrument\\'s natural response function in ways that make the image-reconstruction tractable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data weighting during imaging allows for the improvement of the dynamic range and the ability to adjust the synthesized beam associated with the produced image. The weight given to each visibility sample can be adjusted to fit the desired output. There are several reasons to adjust the weighting, including improving sensitivity to extended sources or accounting for noise variation between samples. The user can adjust the weighting using **clean** and changing the *weighting* parameter with six options: \\'natural\\', \\'uniform\\', \\'briggs\\',  \\'superuniform\\', \\'briggsabs\\', and \\'radial\\'. Optionally, a UV taper can be applied, and various parameters can be set to further adjust the weight calculations.\n",

    "#### Natural weighting\n",
    "\n",
    "*Summary:* The natural weighting scheme gives equal weight to all samples. Since usually, lower spatial frequencies are sampled more often than the higher ones, the inner uv-plane will have a significantly higher density of samples and hence signal-to-noise than the outer uv-plane. The resulting \\\"density-upweighting\\\" of the inner uv-plane will produce the largest angular resolution and can sometimes result in undesirable structure in the PSF which reduces the accuracy of the minor cycle. However, at the location of a source, this method preserves the natural point-source sensitivity of the instrument.\n",
    "\n",
    "For *[weighting=\\'natural\\']{.cmtt-10x-x-109}*, visibilities are weighted only by the data weights, which are calculated during filling and calibration and should be equal to the inverse noise variance on that visibility.

When data is gridded into the same uv-cell for imaging, the weights are summed, and thus a higher uv density results in higher imaging weights. No sub-parameters are linked to this mode choice.

    "*Summary:* Uniform weighting gives equal weight to each measured spatial frequency irrespective of sample density. The resulting PSF has the narrowest possible main lobe (i.e. smallest possible angular resolution) and suppressed sidelobes across the entire image and is best suited for sources with high signal-to-noise ratios to minimize sidelobe contamination between sources. However, the peak sensitivity is significantly worse than optimal (typically \\~20% worse for reasonably large number of antenna interferometers), since data points in densely sampled regions have been weighted down to make the weights uniform. Also, isolated measurements can get artifically high relative weights and this may introduce further artifacts into the PSF.\n",
    "\n",
    "For *[weighting=\\'uniform\\']{.cmtt-10x-x-109}*, the data weights are calculated as in \\'[natural\\' ]{.cmtt-10x-x-109}weighting. The data is then gridded to a number of cells in the uv-plane, and after all data is gridded the uv-cells are re-weighted to have \"uniform\" imaging weights. This pumps up the influence on the image of data with low weights (they are multiplied up to be the same as for the highest weighted data), which sharpens resolution and reduces the sidelobe level in the field-of-view, but increases the rms image noise. No sub-parameters are linked to this mode choice.\n",

When using *Briggs* style weight with *perchanweightdensity=True*, the imaging weight density calculations use only the weights of data that contribute specifically to that channel. On the other hand, when *perchanweightdensity=False*, the imaging weight density calculations sum all of the weights from all of the data channels selected whose (u,v) falls in a given uv cell on the weight density grid. Since the aggregated weights, in any given uv cell, will change depending on the number of channels included when imaging, the psf calculated for a given frequency channel will also necessarily change, resulting in variability in the psf for a given frequency channel when *perchanweightdensity=False*. In general, *perchanweightdensity=False* results in smaller psfs for the same value of robustness compared to *perchanweightdensity=True*, but the rms noise as a function of channel varies and increases toward the edge channels; *perchanweightdensity=True* provides more uniform sensitivity per channel for cubes. This may make it harder to find estimates of continuum when *perchanweightdensity=False*.

The underlying issue with more uniform robust weighting is how the weight density maps onto the uv-grid, which can give high weight to areas of the uv-plane that are not actually more sensitive. The setting *mosweight = True* has long been known as potentially useful in cases where a mosaic has non-uniform sensitivity, but it was found that it is also very important for more uniform values of robust Briggs weighting in the presence of relatively poor uv-coverage. For example, snap-shot ALMA mosaics with *mosweight = False* typically show an increase in noise in the corners or in the areas furthest away from the phase-center.

This means that higher spatial frequencies are weighted down relative to lower spatial frequencies, to suppress artifacts arising from poorely sampled regions near and beyond the maximum spatial frequency in the uv-plane. It is equivalent to smoothing the PSF obtained by other weighting schemes and can be specified either as a Gaussian in uv-space (eg. units of lambda or klambda) or as a Gaussian in the image domain (eg. angular units like arcsec). Because the natural PSF is smoothed out, this tunes the sensitivity of the instrument to scale sizes larger than the angular-resolution of the instrument by increasing the width of the main lobe.

    "### Types of normalization\n",
    "\n",
    "There are multiple ways of normalizing the residual image before beginning minor cycle iterations. One is to divide out the primary beam before deconvolution and another is to divide out the primary beam from the deconvolved image. Both approaches are valid, so it is important to clarify the difference between the two. A third option is included for completeness.\n",
    "\n",
    "For all options, the \\'pblimit\\' parameter controls regions in the image where PB-correction is actually computed. Regions below the pblimit cannot be normalized and are set to zero. For standard imaging, this refers only to the pb-corrected output image. For *gridder=\\'mosaic\\'* and *\\'awproject\\'* it applies to the residual, restored and pb-corrected images.  A small value (e.g. *pblimit=0.01*) can be used to increase the region of the sky actually imaged. For *gridder=\\'standard\\'*, there is no pb-based normalization during gridding and so the value of this parameter is ignored.\\\n",
    "\\\n",
    "The sign of the pblimit parameter is used for a different purpose. If positive, it defines a T/F pixel mask that is attached to the output residual and restored images.  If negative, this T/F pixel mask is not included.  Please note that this pixel mask is different from the deconvolution mask used to control the region where CLEAN based algorithms will search for source peaks.  In order to set a deconvolution mask based on pb level, please use the \\'pbmask\\' parameter.\\\n",
    "\\\n",
    "Based on the above, please note that certain values of pblimit to avoid, are 1, -1, and 0. When the pblimit is set to 1 the entire image is masked as the user is specifying that no normalization or deconvolution happens if the PB gain is lower than 1, which leads to the entire image being masked. Setting the pblimit to -1 also results in no deconvolution as mentioned in the case where pblimit is 1 but there is no masking of the image. Finally a pblimit of zero is not feasible but rather a small value such as 1e-6 is used instead to make a really large wide field image.\n",

    "### Flat-noise\n",
    "\n",
    "The dirty image represents []{.MathJax_Preview style=\"color: inherit;\"}$I^{dirty} = I^{psf} \\star \\left( I^{PB} \\cdot I^{sky} \\right)$\n",
    "\n",
    "Primary-beam correction is not done before the minor cycle deconvolution. The dirty image is the instrument\\'s response to the product of the sky and the primary beam, and therefore the model image will represent the product of the sky brightness and the average primary beam. The noise in the image is related directly to the measurement noise due to the interferometer, and is the same all across the image. The minor cycle can give equal weight to all flux components that it finds. At the end of deconvolution, the primary beam must be divided out of the restored image. This form of normalization is useful when the primary beam is the dominant direction-dependent effect because the images going into the minor cycle satisfy a convolution equation. It is also more appropriate for single-pointing fields-of-view.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imaging with the prolate spheroidal gridder will automatically give flat noise images.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Flat-sky\n",
    "\n",
    "The dirty image represents []{.MathJax_Preview style=\"color: inherit;\"}$I^{dirty} = \\frac{1}{I^{PB}} \\cdot \\left[I^{psf} \\star \\left( I^{PB} \\cdot I^{sky} \\right) \\right]$\n",
    "\n",
    "Approximate Primary-beam correction is done on the dirty image, before the minor cycle iterations. The amplitude of the flux components found during deconvolution will be free of the primary beam, and will represent the true sky. However, the image going into the minor cycle will not satisfy a convolution equation and the noise in the dirty image will be higher in regions where the primary-beam gain is low. Therefore, the minor cycle needs to account for this while searching for flux components (a signal-to-noise dependent CLEAN). This form of normalization is particularly useful for mosaic imaging where the sky brightness can extend across many pointings, or if there is an uneven distribution of weights across pointings. This is because joint mosaics are usually done for sources with spatial scales larger than the field-of-view of each antenna and which are not explicitly present in the measured data. In this situation, allowing the minor cycle to use flux components that span across beams of adjacent pointings is likely to provide a better constraint on the reconstruction of these unmeasured spatial frequencies, and produce smoother large-scale emission.\n",

    "The dirty image represents []{.MathJax_Preview style=\"color: inherit;\"}$I^{dirty} = I^{PB} \\cdot \\left[ I^{psf} \\star \\left( I^{PB} \\cdot I^{sky} \\right) \\right]$\n",
    "\n",
    "This third option (not currenly available for use, but supported internally) is to not do any PB-based divisions after the gridding and FFT (using *gridder=\\'mosaic\\'* or \\'awproject\\', but to let the minor cycle proceed as is.  Advantages of this approach are the elimination of error-inducing divisions by the primary beam (especially in low gain regions and near PB cut-off edges).\n",
