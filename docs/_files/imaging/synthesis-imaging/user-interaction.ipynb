    "### Stopping Criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "True convergence is not very easy to define or identify in practice. This is largely because of the logarithmic convergence typical of chi-square minimization or the presence of artifacts that may prevent true convergence but which would still allow imaging at a quality adequate for subsequent analysis. Imaging algorithms therefore have stopping criteria to decide when to pause a set of minor cycle iterations and to perform a major cycle as well as when to stop iterations altogether.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reasons for stopping\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Threshold\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard stopping criterion is a threshold on the peak brightness in the residual image. When artifacts do not dominate the residuals, such a threshold is a robust way of terminating a run. A global stopping threshold is usually related to the theoretically expected rms (typically []{.MathJax_Preview style=\"color: inherit;\"}$5\\sigma$). A stopping threshold to trigger a major cycle is usually related to the height of the strongest sidelobe of the strongest source. The rationale behind this choice is to expect errors in the subtraction of the contributions of flux components during the minor cycle (due to approximations such as the beam patch size) and to prevent spurious new components from being added to the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Niter\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple stopping criterion is the total number of iterations (individual minor cycle steps). In the presence of artifacts, it is used if one wants to explicitly stop imaging early to prevent divergence or to truncate iterations once they reach the point of diminishing returns. It is usually used as an over-ride for the more natural stopping criteria of thresholding.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Non-Convergence\n",
    "\n",
    "When the data do not exactly conform to what the algorithm is solving for, true convergence and theoretical noise estimates will not be reached. Some symptoms of non convergence include the residual image saturating in rms value or peak residual with no significant changes across minor and major cycle iterations. Of course, increases in absolute model flux that persist could signal divergence.\n",
