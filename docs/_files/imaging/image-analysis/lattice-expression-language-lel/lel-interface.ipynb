    "\n",
    "      Float clipValue = 10;\n",

    "\n",
    "forms an expression to clip the image. Note that the expression is written as a normal C++ expression. The overloaded operators and functions in class LatticeExprNode ensure that the expression is formed in the correct way. Note that a `LatticeExprNode` object is usually automatically converted to a templated `LatticeExpr` object, which makes it possible to use it as a normal `Lattice`. So far the expression is only formed, but not evaluated. Evaluation is only done when the expression is used in an operation, e.g. as the source of the copy operation shown below.\n",
