    "This consists of 2 parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "1\\. The function `command` in Images/ImageExprParse.h can be used to\n",

    "example does the same as the Python&nbsp;one shown above. E.g.\n",

    "that C++ variables can be used. Class LatticeExprNode contains functions\n",
    "to form an expression. The same operators and functions as in the\n",
    "command interface are available. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "      Float clipValue = 10;\n",
    "      PagedImage<Float> image(\"imagein\");\n",
    "      LatticeExpr<Float> expr(min(image,clipValue));\n",
    "\n",
    "forms an expression to clip the image. Note that the expression is\n",
    "written as a normal C++ expression. The overloaded operators and\n",
    "functions in class LatticeExprNode ensure that the expression is formed\n",
    "in the correct way. Note that a `LatticeExprNode` object is usually\n",
    "automatically converted to a templated `LatticeExpr` object, which makes\n",
    "it possible to use it as a normal `Lattice`. So far the expression is\n",
    "only formed, but not evaluated. Evaluation is only done when the\n",
    "expression is used in an operation, e.g. as the source of the copy\n",
    "operation shown below.\n",
