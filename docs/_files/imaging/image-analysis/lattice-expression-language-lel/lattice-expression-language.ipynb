    "The Lattice Expression Language (LEL) makes it possible to do arithmetic\n",
    "on lattices (in particular on images \\[which are just lattices plus\n",
    "coordinates\\]). An expression can be seen as a lattice (or image) in\n",
    "itself. It can be used in any operation where a normal image is used.\n",

    "LEL operates on lattices, which are a generalization of arrays. As said\n",
    "above a particular type of lattice is an image; they will be used most\n",
    "often. Because lattices can be very large and usually reside on disk, an\n",
    "expression is only evaluated when a chunk of its data is requested. This\n",
    "is similar to reading only the requested chunk of data from a disk file.\n",
    "\n",
    "LEL is quite efficient and can therefore be used well in C++ and Python\n",
    "code. Note however, that it can never be as efficient as carefully\n",
    "constructed C++ code."
