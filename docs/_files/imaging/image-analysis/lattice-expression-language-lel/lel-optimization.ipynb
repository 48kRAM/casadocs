    "-   As said in the introduction a LEL expression is evaluated in chunks. However, a scalar subexpression is executed only once when getting the first chunk. E.g. in\n",
    "\n",
    "          lat1 + mean(lat2)\n",

    "-   Often the exponent 2 is used in the `pow` function (or operator `^`). This is optimized by using multiplication instead of using the system pow function. \n",
    "\n",
    "-   When LEL finds a [masked-off scalar](https://casa.nrao.edu/casadocs-devel/stable/imaging/image-analysis/lattice-expression-language-lel/lel-expressions) in a subexpression, it does not evaluate the other operand. Instead it sets the result immediately to a masked-off scalar. Exceptions are the operators AND and OR and function `iif`, because their masks depend on the operand values.\n",

    "-   It is strongly recommended to combine scalars into a subexpression to avoid unnecessary scalar-lattice operations. E.g.\n",

    "    In the future LEL will be optimized to shuffle the operands when possible and needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   It is important to be careful with the automatic data type promotion of single precision lattices. Several scalar functions (e.g. pi) produce a double precision value, so using `pi` with a single precision lattice causes the lattice to be promoted to double precision. If accuracy allows it, it is much better to convert `pi` to single precision. E.g. assume `lat1` and `lat2` are single precision lattices.\n",

    "          atan2(lat1,lat2) + pi()/2\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "          atan2(lat1,lat2) + float(pi())/2\n",

    "    avoids that (expensive) data type promotion. \n",

    "-   `POW(LAT,2)` or `LAT``^``2` is faster than `LAT*LAT`, because it accesses lattice `LAT` only once.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "-   `POW(U,2) + POW(V,2) < 1000``^``2` is considerably faster than\\\n",
    "    `SQRT(SQUARE(U) + SQUARE(V)) < 1000`, because it avoids the `SQRT` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   LEL can be used with disk-based lattices and/or memory-based lattices. When used with memory-based lattices it is better to make subexpressions the first operand in another subexpression or a function. E.g.\\\n",
    "    `lat1*lat2 + lat3`\\\n",
    "    is better than\\\n",
    "    `lat3 + lat1*lat2`\\\n",
    "    The reason is that in the first case no copy needs to be made of the lattice data which already reside in memory. All LEL operators and functions try to reference the data of their latter operands instead of making a copy.\\\n",
    "    In general this optimization does not apply to LEL expression. However, when using the true [C++ interface](https://casa.nrao.edu/casadocs-devel/stable/imaging/image-analysis/lattice-expression-language-lel/lel-interface) to classes like `LatticeExprNode`, one can easily use memory-based lattices. In that case it can be advantageous to pay attention to this optimization."
