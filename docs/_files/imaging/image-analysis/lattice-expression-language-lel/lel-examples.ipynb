    "The following examples show some LEL expressions (equally valid in C++ or Glish).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that LEL is readonly; i.e. it does not change any value in the images given. A function in the `image` client has to be used to do something with the result (e.g. storing in another image).\n",

    "-   `mean(myimage:nomask) -- `results in a scalar value giving the mean of the image. No mask is used for the image, thus all pixels are used. The scalar value can be used as a lattice. E.g. it can be used as the source in the `image` function `replacemaskedpixels` to set all masked-off elements of a lattice to the mean.\n",
    "-   `complex(lat1,lat2) -- `results in a complex lattice formed by `lat1` as the real part and `lat2` as the imaginary part.\n",
    "-   `min(lat1, 2*mean(lat1)) -- `results in a lattice where `lat1` is clipped at twice its mean value.\n",
    "-   `min(myimage, 2*mean(mymage[myregion])) -- `results in an image where `myimage` is clipped at twice the mean value of region `myregion` in the image..\n",
    "-   `lat1[lat1>2*min(lat1)]` \\-- results in a lattice with a mask. Only the pixels greater than twice the minimum are valid.\n",
    "-   `replace(lat1)`Â  \\-- results in a lattice where each masked-off element in `lat1` is replaced by 0.\n",
    "-   `iif(lat1<mean(lat1),lat1*2,lat1/2) -- `results in a lattice where the elements less than the mean are doubled and the elements greater or equal to the mean are divided by 2.\n",
