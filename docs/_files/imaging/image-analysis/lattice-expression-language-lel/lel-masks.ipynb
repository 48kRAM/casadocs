    "A boolean mask associated with an image indicates whether a pixel is\n",
    "good (mask value True) or bad (mask value False). If the mask value is\n",

    "the mean of the image).\n",

    "An image can have zero (all pixels are good) or more masks. One mask can\n",

    "**ia.maskhandler** method of the Image tool).\n",

    "\n",
    "creates a mask for `lat1` indicating that only its elements fulfilling\n",
    "the boolean condition should be taken into account in the `sum`\n",
    "function. Note that the mask is local to that part of the expression. So\n",
    "in the expression\n",
    "\n",
    "      sum( lat1[lat1<5 && lat1>10] ) + sum(lat1)\n",
    "\n",
    "the second `sum` function takes all elements into account. Masking can\n",

    "condition](https://casa.nrao.edu/casadocs-devel/stable/imaging/image-analysis/lattice-expression-language-lel/lel-expressions)\n",
    "and the operator `[]`, or a mask defining a\n",
    "[region](https://casa.nrao.edu/casadocs-devel/stable/imaging/image-analysis/lattice-expression-language-lel/lel-regions)\n",
    "within its bounding box.  \n",
    "A pixel is bad when the image has a mask and when the mask value for\n",
    "that pixel is False. Functions like `max` ignore the bad pixels.  \n",
    "Note that in a MeasurementSet a False mask value indicates a good\n",
    "visibility. Alas this is a historically grown distinction in\n",
    "radio-astronomy.  \n",
    "Image masks are combined and propagated throughout an expression. E.g.\n",
    "when two lattices are added, the mask of the result is formed by and-ing\n",
    "the masks of the two lattices. That is, the resultant mask is True where\n",
    "the mask of lattice one is true AND the mask of lattice 2 is True.\n",
    "Otherwise, the resultant mask is False.  \n",
    "In general the mask of a subexpression is formed by and-ing the masks of\n",
    "the operands. This is true for e.g. +, \\*, `atan2`, etc.. However, there\n",
    "are a few special cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   The mask created by `operator[condition]` is formed by and-ing the\n",
    "    condition result, the mask of the result, and the mask of the\n",
    "    subexpression where the condition is applied to. For example,\n",
    "    suppose `lat1` and `lat2` each have a mask. Then in\n",
    "\n",
    "          sum( lat1[lat2<5] )\n",
    "\n",
    "    the `sum` function will only sum those elements for which the mask\n",
    "    of `lat1` and `lat2` is valid and for which the condition is true. \n",
    "\n",
    "-   The logical AND operator forms the resultant mask by looking at the\n",

    "    Let us say both `lat1` and `lat2` have masks. The operand `lat1<0`\n",

    "    the values true, false, and undefined. \n",

    "    its mask is true. \n",
    "\n",
    "-   The logical OR operator works the same as the AND operator. If an\n",
    "    operand has a true value the other operand can be ignored.\n",

    "\n",
    "-   The `iif` function has three operands. Depending on the condition,\n",
    "    an element from the second or third operand has to be taken. The\n",
    "    resultant mask is formed by the mask of the condition and-ed with\n",
    "    the appropriate elements from the masks of the second or third\n",
    "    operand.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   The `value` function returns the value without a mask, thus it\n",
    "    removes the mask from a value. It has the same effect as the\n",
    "    `image:nomask` construction discussed above. However, the `value`\n",
    "    function is more general, because it can also be applied to a\n",
    "    subexpression.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   The `mask` function returns the mask of a value. The returned value\n",

    "The first two use the default mask of `image2` as the mask for\n",
    "`image1`.  \n",
    "The latter uses `mask0` of `image2` as the mask for `image1`. It is\n",
    "equivalent to the first two examples if `mask0` is the default mask of\n",
    "`image2`.  \n",
    "It is possible that the entire mask of a subexpression is false. For\n",
    "example, if the mean of such a subexpression is taken, the result is\n",
    "undefined. This is fully supported by LEL, because a scalar value also\n",
    "has a mask associated with it. One can see a masked-off scalar as a\n",
