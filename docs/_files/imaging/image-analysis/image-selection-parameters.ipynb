    "Many of the image analysis tasks contain a set of parameters that can be used to define a sub-section of an image that the task works on. This includes selection in the spatial coordinates, typically RA/DEC or GLON/GLAT (or image axes 0,1) which can be defined by the *box* parameter. Spectral selection can be achieved by the *chans* parameter (typically axis 3) and Stokes selection with the *stokes* parameter (typically axis 2). These parameters are described below and are a quick way to select sub-images. For more complicated selections, we recommend the usage of the [CASA region file](https://casa.nrao.edu/casadocs-devel/stable/imaging/image-analysis/region-files) ([CRTF file](https://casa.nrao.edu/casadocs-devel/stable/imaging/image-analysis/region-file-format)).    \n",

    "Direction (e.g. RA, Dec) areal selection in the image analysis tasks is controlled by the *box* parameter or through the *region* parameter. Note that one should either specify a region (recommended) or any of *box*/*chans*/*stokes* parameters. Specifying both at the same time will give priority to the command line inputs in \\'chans\\' and \\'stokes\\' but will keep the region file specification for the spatial region selection.\n",
