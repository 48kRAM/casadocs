    "The CASA image analysis module contains an image analysis tool with numerous methods, as well as several higher level tasks. The tasks free users from the burden of resource management, and offer what many consider to be a more user-friendly interface available via the input \\<taskname\\> CASA command. In many cases, image analysis tasks are really just simple wrappers around analogous tool methods (e.g., the **imcollapse** task is just a relatively simple wrapper around the **ia.collapse**() tool method call), although in some cases, such as with the **imregrid** task, the mapping is not as simple, and much more goes on \\\"under the hood\\\" of a task.\n",

    "A region designates a subset of pixels in the image in which one is interested. The region is selected based on coordinate information. Such a selection complements on-the-fly masks in which pixels are selected based on a mathematical expression which is tested against their values (see below). Regions may be specified in several ways. The region manager tool (default **rg**) has several methods for generating regions. These methods generally return a dictionary representation of a region which can be used as input for the *region* parameter in various image analysis tool methods and tasks. A region can also be specified by the *box*/*chans*/*stokes* selection parameters in tasks and tool methods which accept them. Regions can also be specified in a special format known as CASA region text format. This format allows for specifying of various region shapes and spectral and polarization extents. This specification can be placed in a file, and in this case, the *region* parameter can be set to the name of that file and the region information will be extracted. Alternatively, the *region* parameter can be set directly to the CRTF specification. The complete CRTF specification can be found in the \\\"[Region File Format](https://casa.nrao.edu/casadocs-devel/stable/imaging/image-analysis/region-file-format)\\\" section.\n",

    "## Pixel Masks\n",
    "\n",
    "A pixel mask is a set of boolean values which have a one-to-one correspondence with image pixels. A value of True indicates that pixel is \\\"good\\\" (i.e., should be used in computations), while a value of False indicates that pixel is \\\"bad\\\". For example, blanked pixels in a FITS image are treated as \\\"bad\\\" by CASA. When such a file is imported into a CASA image, a pixel mask is created to reflect the badness of blanked pixels in the FITS image. For persistent CASA images, pixel masks are stored in the same directory in which other image information is stored.\n",

    "If an image does not have a pixel mask associated with it, all of its pixels are treated as good by CASA.\n",
    "\n",
    "A CASA image may contain any number of pixel masks and these masks can be managed via the **ia.maskhandler**() image analysis tool method. If an image contains multiple pixel masks, only a maximum of one mask will be used during a run of a task or tool method. This pixel mask is known as the \\\"default\\\" pixel mask. The default pixel mask can be set by running **ia.maskhandler**(*set=\\\"pixelmaskname\\\"*). You can also indicate that none of the image pixel masks should be applied by running **ia.maskhandler**(*set=\\\"\\\"*). In this case, all pixels are considered to be good. Pixel masks can also be viewed in the output of the **ia.summary**() image analysis tool method and **imhead** task output.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **ia.putregion**() image analysis tool method run with *usemask=True* can be used to change the values of the default pixel mask. The image analysis tool method **ia.set**() can also be used to set the values of the default pixel mask. The image analysis tool method **ia.calcmask**() can be used to create a new pixel mask based on a boolean LEL expression.\n",

One can even convert a region specification into a persistent pixel mask by specifying the *region* parameter in e.g., the **ia.fromimage**() image analysis tool method. The created image will have a default pixel mask that is a representation of the region specified (if the initial image had a default pixel mask, then that will be ANDed with the region specification to form the default pixel mask of the resulting image)."
