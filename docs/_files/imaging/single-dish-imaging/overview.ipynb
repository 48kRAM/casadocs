The output of [sdimaging](https://casa.nrao.edu/casadocs-devel/stable/global-task-list/task_sdimaging) is a CASA image that can be explored, analyzed, and manipulated in CASA, or exported into a versatile FITS image format via [exportfits](https://casa.nrao.edu/casadocs-devel/stable/global-task-list/task_exportfits).\n",
