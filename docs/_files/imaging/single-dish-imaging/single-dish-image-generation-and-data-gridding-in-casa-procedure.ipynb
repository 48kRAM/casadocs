    "Of course, users can tune their data products by specifying the image size and dimensions, the frequency/velocity characteristics, the gridding and data filtering and smoothing parameters, and so on. The defaults for **sdimaging** for image resolution (i.e. cellsize in arcsec) is determined from the rest frequency of the 0th spectral window so that there are three pixel elements across the beam, the beam being calculated with []{.MathJax_Preview style=\"color: inherit;\"}$b\\times\\frac{\\lambda}{D}$.  See information here about tapering: [PrimaryBeamArcsec](https://safe.nrao.edu/wiki/bin/view/ALMA/PrimaryBeamArcsec). The image extent is computed by default so that the sampled area is completely encompassed in a single rectangle, and the pixel dimension follows naturally from maxsize/cellsize. The default image center (the somewhat inappropriately-named *phasecenter* parameter) is computed simply as the center of that region.\n",

The recommended setting for ALMA data is a spherical (\\'SF\\') kernel. The *convsupport* parameter defines the cut-off radius for \\'SF\\' in units of pixels, defaulting to 3 pixels.  However, the recommended value for ALMA data is convsupport=6 (see [sdimaging](https://casa.nrao.edu/casadocs-devel/stable/global-task-list/task_sdimaging) and Mangum et al. 2007 [\\[1\\]](#Bibliography) for more details on these parameters).\n",

At present, the weighting for stokes I is computed consistently with historical usage: I=XX/2+YY/2.  While this is mathematically consistent with the computation of stokes I, it is an incorrect treatment since the computation necessarily must incorporate the contributions from Q and U. Ordinarily, these terms cancel out from the computation of stokes I, but their error parameters must be incorporated, and historically, this is not respected. \n",
    "\n",
    "CASA development is seeking to make the computation of the weights consistent with a proper computation of stokes I, and this is done in **sdfit**, but it is not yet completed for **sdimaging. ** However, to emphasize, while the current implementation of computation for stokes I by **sdimaging** is consistent with convention, the convention is formally incorrect.\n",
