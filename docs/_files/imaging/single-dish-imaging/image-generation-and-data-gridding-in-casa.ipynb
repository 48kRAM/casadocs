    "Converting single-dish observations into an image or cube is done almost\n",
    "entirely in the image domain. After taking and calibrating the data, the\n",
    "process follows three steps:\n",

    "2.  Populating the image grid\n",
    "3.  Smoothing the image data\n",

    "The fundamental parameter relevant to image quality is the sampling\n",
    "interval. There are a number of sampling functions that need to be\n",
    "considered: the sky sampling function, the image grid sampling function,\n",
    "and the response function of the single-dish beam. These functions all\n",
    "convolve against each other to yield an effective image resolution\n",
    "somewhat poorer than the actual theoretical FWHM of the telescope\n",
    "primary beam.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dimensions and extent of the image grid are determined by the mapped\n",
    "area on the sky. The gridding pixel size must be at least one half the\n",
    "size of the theoretical beam when convolved with the sky-sampling\n",
    "function. Since the sky sampling function is typically 1/3 to 1/5 of the\n",
    "primary beam, and the effective FWHM of the telescope and sky sampling\n",
    "function is close to that of the telescope anyway, it's safe to use a\n",
    "pixel dimension that is 1/3th the width of the primary beam.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a 30\" telescope beam with a 6\" sky sampling function has an\n",
    "effective FWHM of $\\sim \\sqrt{(30^2+6^2)}\\simeq$ 30.6\".\n",
    "Therefore, computing an image pixel size that is 30\"/3 = 10\", is\n",
    "appropriately oversampling the effective beam FWHM and sampling\n",
    "interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the coordinates of the data are transformed into sky coordinates,\n",
    "the image grid is formed with dimensions either consistent with the user\n",
    "specifications, or so that the image fully encompasses the observed sky\n",

    "\n",
    "For each pixel in the grid (e.g. in RA-Dec space), the gridding process\n",
    "searches through the data for measurements taken within some cutoff\n",
    "radius (specified by&nbsp;*convsupport*). Depending on their distance\n",
    "from the grid coordinate, the observation is weighted according to\n",
    "the&nbsp;*kernel* type and added together in the spatial domain (i.e.\n",
    "entire spectra are added together). If the&nbsp;*clipminmax* function is\n",
    "invoked, the maximum AND minimium data in the ensemble (prior to\n",
