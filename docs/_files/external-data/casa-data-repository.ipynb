    "[Each CASA distribution comes with a minimal repository of binary data that is required for CASA to function properly. This repository includes [Measures Tables](https://casa.nrao.edu/casadocs-devel/stable/external-data/casacore-measures-tables) that deal with reference frames, as well as ephemeris data. Over time (couple of months), the geodetic and possibly ephemeris data in this repository slowly drifts out of date. Because of this, the distribution data repository must be updated occasionally. Other data that is updated less frequently is also stored in the repository, such as beam models, antenna and Jy/K correction tables, and the antenna configuration files for the CASA simulator.]\n",
