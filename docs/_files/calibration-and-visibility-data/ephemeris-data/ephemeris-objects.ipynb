    "    \\\"cubesource\\\". The ephemeris provides the location of the phase\n",
    "    center and the radial velocity of the target.\n",
    "2.  An ephemeris table is also necessary if your observation has tracked\n",
    "    some other phase center but you would like to track the location\n",
    "    described by the ephemeris. This can be achieved by setting the\n",

    "transformation of the spectral reference frame, however, a geocentric\n",
    "ephemeris is necessary. The **importasdm** task will therefore by\n",

    "the ephemeris. Thus, if the field center is exactly at the position\n",
    "described by the ephemeris, the nominal entries of the direction column\n",
    "are zero for right ascension and declination. The offset feature of the\n",
    "FIELD table direction column comes into play in the case of a mosaic: if\n",
    "there are a number of fields with nearby positions, the fields can share\n",
    "an ephemeris; they all reference the same ephemeris table via the\n",
    "optional column EPHEMERIS_ID, but have different offsets in their\n",
