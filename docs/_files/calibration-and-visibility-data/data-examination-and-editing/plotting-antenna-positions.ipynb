Its value is a string to select which antennas to exclude, using the same syntax as the antenna parameter in [MeasurementSet selection](https://casa.nrao.edu/casadocs-devel/stable/calibration-and-visibility-data/data-selection-in-a-measurementset). For example, *exclude=\\\"5\\~6\\\"* would exclude the PM antennas from the plot in Figure 1.\n",

    "-   The \\'Zoom-to-rectangle\\' button (magnifier icon, fifth from left) is used to mark a rectangular region with the mouse in order to zoom in on the plot.\n",
    "-   The \\'Subplot-configuration\\' button (sixth icon) can be used to stretch or compress the left, right, top, or bottom of the plot, as well as the ability to reset the plot to the original shape after manipulation before exiting the configuration dialog.\n",
    "-   The \\'Save\\' button (rightmost icon) is used to export the plot. A file save dialog is launched to select a location, name, and format (default png) for the file.\n",
