      The task **listsdm** summarizes the content of archival data in
      the format that is used by ALMA and the VLA for visibility data
      transport and archiving (the `Science Data
      Model <https://casa.nrao.edu/casadocs-devel/stable/casa-fundamentals/the-science-data-model>`__,
      known as ASDM for ALMA). The output in the casalog is very similar
      to that of **listobs**, which reads the metadata after conversion
      to a MeasurementSet (see next section). **listsdm** therefore does
      not require the SDM to be filled into an MS. The output of
      **listsdm** is also returned as a dictionary.
