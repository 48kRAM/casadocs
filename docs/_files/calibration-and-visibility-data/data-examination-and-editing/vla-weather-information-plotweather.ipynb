The panel at the top displays the following properties as a fiunction of time across the observation: elevation of the sun, wind speed and direction, temperature and dew point, and precipitable water vapor (pwv). The bottom panel shows the calculated zenith opacity as a function of  frequency. The opacities calculated from the actual weather data, from a seasonal model and the specified mix of both are shown in the PWV and Tau plots. \n",
