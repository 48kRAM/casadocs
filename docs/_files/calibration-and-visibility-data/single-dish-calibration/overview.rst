      This section describes the motivation, background, and process for
      calibrating ALMA single-dish observations.

      Below are brief descriptions of the calibration process, followed
      by a description of the various observing modes, and then a
      step-by-step description of the calibration process in CASA.

      It is recommended that newcomers review the description of
      calibration in `Single-dish calibration:
      background <https://casa.nrao.edu/casadocs-devel/stable/calibration-and-visibility-data/single-dish-calibration/single-dish-calibration-background>`__ and
      descriptions of various observing modes in `Single-dish observing
      modes <https://casa.nrao.edu/casadocs-devel/stable/calibration-and-visibility-data/single-dish-calibration/single-dish-observing-modes>`__ before
      examining the reduction processes decribed in `Single-dish data
      calibration and
      reduction <https://casa.nrao.edu/casadocs-devel/stable/calibration-and-visibility-data/single-dish-calibration/single-dish-data-calibration-and-reduction>`__.
      Future directions are broadly outlined in `Future development
      goals for CASA
      single-dish <https://casa.nrao.edu/casadocs-devel/stable/calibration-and-visibility-data/single-dish-calibration/future-development-goals-for-casa-single-dish>`__.
