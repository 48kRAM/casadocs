    "have differences in the cadence and position of the OFF measurements.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of the PS mode, the OFF position is specified by the PI\n",
    "before the observations.  The OFF positions have a specific and periodic\n",
    "cadence and should, where possible, be at approximately the same azimuth\n",

    "For OTF-raster, the telescope scans the observing target, including some\n",

    "For OTF mode, the observations are not rasterized.  The scanning pattern\n",
    "for OTF observations can take several forms.  Solar observations, for\n",
    "example, use a double-circle scan. In this case the entire periphery of\n",
    "the observed region is identified as an OFF measurement.  The OTF-raster\n",
    "mode, on the other hand, uses the first and last points of the raster\n",
    "rows as the OFF. A mean bandpass is formed from the OFF measurements,\n",
    "interpolated in time, and applied to any measurements not identified as\n",
    "OFF.  For OTF and OTF-raster, specific OFF posiotions are not explicitly\n",
