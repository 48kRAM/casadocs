    "The **split** task selects a subset of data from a MeasurementSet and creates a new MS with only those selected data.  All of the usual selection criteria can be applied (field, spectral window, antenna, time range, etc.). Additionally the user can choose to select only a single column of data (typically CORRECTED); the user may also elect to export all data columns (DATA, MODEL, CORRECTED, FLOAT_DATA). If only a single column is selected, it will  appear as the DATA column in the output MS, unless the input *datacolumn* is set to FLOAT_DATA. In this case the output column will also be FLOAT_DATA. This suite of capabilities is of great utility for creating smaller MeasurementSets for imaging and further analysis. It is also helpful in many circumstances to facilitate self-calibration, since the **gaincal** task operates from the DATA column. \n",

    "Starting in CASA 4.6.0, **split2** has been renamed to **split** and became the default in CASA. The previous implementation of **split** is still available under the name **oldsplit**. The interface of both implementations is the same, but the new **split** uses the MSTransform framework underneath.
