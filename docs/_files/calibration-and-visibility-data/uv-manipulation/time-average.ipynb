    "**Warning:** the timebin parameter works based on wall clock time, not integration time.  For example, if each scan is 5 seconds long, and scans are separated by 15 seconds, then timebin=\\'25s\\' is the minimum value needed to combine data from 2 consecutive scans. One might assume that timebin=\\'10s\\' should work to combine two 5 second scans, but it does not. This is mostly relevant to single dish data, and when using the tasks like sdtimeaverage or mstransform.\n",

    "-   Whereas the old version of split used exclusively the *WEIGHT* column to perform the weighted average, **mstransform** and **split** use both *FLAG* and spectral weights (when present). To be specific *WEIGHT_SPECTRUM* is used when averaring *CORRECTED_DATA*, and *SIGMA_SPECTRUM* is used when averaging the *DATA* column.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Also **mstransform** and **split** are able to transform the input *WEIGHT/SIGMA_SPECTRUM* according to the rules of error propagation that apply to a weighted average, which result in an output weight equals to the sum of the input weights. For a detailed reference see, Data Reduction and Error Analysis by Bevington & Robinson [\\[2\\]](#Bibliography).\n",

    "-   *maxuvdistance*: In the case of **mstransform**, when *maxuvdistance* is greater than 0 this parameter controls the maximum uv distance allowed when averaging data from the same baseline. It works in conjunction with the *timebin* parameter in the sense that the averaging process is finalized when either *timebin* is completed or *maxuvdistance* is reached.
