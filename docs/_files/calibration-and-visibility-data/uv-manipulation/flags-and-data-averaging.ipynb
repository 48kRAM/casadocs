    "CASA uses common infrastructure to implement data average transformations across different tasks. This infrastructure follows certain common rules to propagate flags from the original data to the averaged data. This page explains the common rules that different CASA tasks follow to produce the flags of averaged data; in other words, these rules dictate how data averaging transformations propagate the flags from the original data to the averaged data. \n",
    "\n",
    "These rules apply to [channel average](https://casa.nrao.edu/casadocs-devel/stable/calibration-and-visibility-data/uv-manipulation/channel-average) and [time average](https://casa.nrao.edu/casadocs-devel/stable/calibration-and-visibility-data/uv-manipulation/time-average), as implemented by\n",

    "In short, the rule that CASA follows for the propagation of flags from the original input data to the averaged data is a logical AND. This is detailed in the next section. The second subsection explains how tasks such as flagdata and plotms propagate back the averaged flags to the input MeasurementSet.\n",
    "\n",
    "In what follows we explain how CASA treats flags and data when using data averaging. By the term *data*, we refer to the data columns present in a MeasurementSet (DATA, CORRECTED_DATA, etc.). The data always have a companion FLAG column, with matching dimensions. The data also have other companion columns related to weights: WEIGHT, SIGMA, WEIGHT_SPECTRUM, SIGMA_SPECTRUM. The focus of this page is on data flags. But data average, and the use of the data weights in the average, also plays a role in the explanations below. The treatment of data weights in CASA is explained in more detail in [Data weights](https://casa.nrao.edu/casadocs-devel/stable/calibration-and-visibility-data/data-weights).\n",

    "For a given bin of input data and flags, the averaged flags are calculated as the logical \\\"AND\\\" of all the flags in the input bin (timebin or chanbin). The averaged flag will be set only if all the flags in the input bin are set.\\\n",
    "Let us first illustrate this with examples. For simplicity we consider some examples of channel average.\\\n",
    "The flags for every data channel are represented by an \\'X\\' (flag set) or a \\'O\\' (flag unset). There are 12 channels and we try different channel bins:\n",

    "The implication of this AND rule is that after applying the averaging transformation the percentage of data flagged can only remain the same or decrease. And it will tend to decrease more as the bin size increases. It will also tend to decrease more for more sparse patterns of original flags. In an averaged dataset one should expect a lower percentage of flags, proportionally to the bin size used and the sparseness of the flags of the original data.\n",
    "\n",
    "For time average the same principle applies, on a per-baseline basis, with the only difference that the bins are defined across time instead of channels.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The AND rule of propagation of flags to the averaged data\n",
    "\n",
    "The logical \\\"AND\\\" rule can be formulated as follows. Let us consider a bin size []{.MathJax_Preview style=\"color: inherit;\"}$n$, and original data []{.MathJax_Preview style=\"color: inherit;\"}$d_i, i=0,... n-1$, with associated flags, []{.MathJax_Preview style=\"color: inherit;\"}$f_i$. Every subindex []{.MathJax_Preview style=\"color: inherit;\"}$_i$ corresponds to a value of the data column for a given baseline, time and channel. As a convention, []{.MathJax_Preview style=\"color: inherit;\"}$f_i = 1$ when the flag is set, and []{.MathJax_Preview style=\"color: inherit;\"}$f_i = 0$ when the flag is not set.\\\n",
    "For every data point produced in the averaged data, []{.MathJax_Preview style=\"color: inherit;\"}$d_{avg}$, its flag, []{.MathJax_Preview style=\"color: inherit;\"}$f_{avg}$, is calculated as:\\\n",

    "[]{.MathJax_Preview style=\"color: inherit;\"}$f_{avg} = \\prod_{i=0}^{n-1} f_i$\\\n",
    "\\\n",
    "That is, the value of the averaged flag is defined as the product of the values of the flags in the input bin.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How flags and data are averaged\n",
    "\n",
    "Does the \\\"AND\\\" rule mean that flagged data becomes unflagged via averaging? No, this doesn\\'t mean that CASA uses flagged data or unsets the flags of the initially flagged data. If any data point in the input bin is not flagged, the averaged data point will be not flagged. But this does not imply that flagged data is propagated to the averaged data. When one or more of the data in the input bin are no flagged, only the data that are not flagged are used in the average. The flagged data in the original bin are excluded from the average. These are the two possible scenarios:\n",
    "\n",
    "A\\) If one or more unflagged data points can be found in the input bin, the averaged data will be produced as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   averaged data: calculated as the average of the input data points that are not flagged.\n",
    "-   averaged flag: not set\n",
    "\n",
    "B\\) Only if all the data points in the input bin are flagged, then the averaged data will be produced as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   averaged data: calculated as the average of all the input data in the bin (all flagged).\n",
    "-   averaged flag: set\n",
    "\n",
    "To define an equation of data averaging with flags, let us now consider the data weights. A bin of []{.MathJax_Preview style=\"color: inherit;\"}$n$ data points []{.MathJax_Preview style=\"color: inherit;\"}$d_i, i=0,...n-1$, with flags []{.MathJax_Preview style=\"color: inherit;\"}$f_i$, are averaged into an average data point []{.MathJax_Preview style=\"color: inherit;\"}$d_{avg}$ with flag []{.MathJax_Preview style=\"color: inherit;\"}$f_{avg}$. The []{.MathJax_Preview style=\"color: inherit;\"}$d_i$ are the visibility data and the []{.MathJax_Preview style=\"color: inherit;\"}$w_i$ are their respective weights. CASA calculates the averaged data, []{.MathJax_Preview style=\"color: inherit;\"}$d_{avg}$ as:\\\n",

    "### Writing and (back)propagation of flags from the averaged data to the original data (input MeasurementSet)\n",
    "\n",
    "This section concerns tasks such as flagdata or plotms which can apply on-the-fly average, either time or frequency, flag and/or unflag data, and write the averaged flags back to the original  MeasurementSet. These tasks have the additional complexity that they need to be able to propagate back to the original MeasurementSet flags from averaged data+flags that have been transformed on-the-fly. A reverse or backward propagation is required to map the averaged flags to the original MeasurementSet.\\\n",
    "\\\n",
    "These tasks can perform the following sequence of data manipulation steps, all in one go:\\\n",
    "a) Take an input MeasurementSet and apply averaging on the data+flags.\\\n",
    "b) Edit or modify the averaged flags.\\\n",
    "c) Write the edited averaged flags back to the original input MeasurementSet.\\\n",
    "\\\n",
    "Since CASA 5.7/6.1, CASA implements two alternative approaches to step c:\\\n",
    "1) flagdata alternative: preserve pre-existing flags, flags can be added (set) but never removed (unset).\\\n",
    "2) plotms alternative: flags can be added (set) but also removed (unset).\\\n",
    "\\\n",
    "Flagdata will only add new flags (true or 1) to the original data. It will never unset a previously set flag.\\\n",
    "This is implemented as follows. If an averaged flag is set, the flag is propagated back to all the original flags in the corresponding input bin. If an averaged flag is not set, nothing is done, and the flags that might be set in the corresponding input bin remain set. As a consequence, a flagdata command that uses data average will only increase the amount of flags in the input MeasurmentSet (or simply keep the same amount, if the flagging methods applied do not add any new flags). This way, all original flags are preserved in the input MeasurementSet.\\\n",
    "\\\n",
    "In contrast, plotms will write back to the input MeasurementSet both true (1) and false (0) flag values. That is, plotms can set and unset flags, and the initially set flags in the input MeasurementSet are not necessarily preserved."
