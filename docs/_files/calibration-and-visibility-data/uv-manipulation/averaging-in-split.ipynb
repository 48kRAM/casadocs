    "Time and channel averaging are available within **split**&nbsp;using the\n",
    "*timebin* and *width* parameters. The way that time averaging operates\n",
    "can be further controlled by&nbsp;*combine*, which is a sub-parameter\n",
    "of&nbsp;*timebin.*\n",
    "\n",
    "The *timebin* parameter gives the averaging interval. It takes a\n",
    "quantity, e.g.&nbsp;*timebin='30s'* for 30-second time averaging.\n",
    "&nbsp;By default the time-span of time averaging will be limited by scan\n",
    "boundaries,&nbsp;*i.e.* the time average will not be extended to average\n",
    "data from multiple scans together. Similarly, time averaging will by\n",
    "default not extend across state boundaries (states are\n",
    "telescope-specific entities; for ALMA a state corresponds to a\n",
    "sub-scan). &nbsp;These default limits on time averaging can be modified\n",
    "by setting&nbsp;*combine*&nbsp;to '*scan'*, '*state'*, or '*state,scan'*\n",
    "to ignore one or both types of boundaries and average across them.\n",
    "&nbsp;*combine* is a sub-parameter of&nbsp;*timebin* which\n",
    "is&nbsp;enabled by selecting a non-zero time averaging interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "The *width* parameter defines the number of channels to average to form\n",
    "a given output channel. This can be specified globally for all spw, e.g.\n",
    "\n",
    "width = 5\n",
    "\n",
    "or specified per spw, e.g.\n",
