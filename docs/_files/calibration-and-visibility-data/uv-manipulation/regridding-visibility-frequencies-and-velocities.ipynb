This implies a \\\"software Doppler tracking\\\", i.e. the SPW definitions are transformed into the BARY frame and in the different integrations of the dataset, the visibilties are regridded into the transformed SPW accounting for the time-dependencies. E.g. if the original SPWs were in reference frame TOPO and thus the movent of the Earth w.r.t. the source will have smeared out line emission, the new SPWs will be in reference frame BARY and the effects of the movement of the Earth will have been removed but the number of channels will remain the same and the frequency resolution will be maximal. \n",
    "\n",
    "Mode *channel* is intended to not change the frequency resolution beyond the reference frame transformation or at least only change the resolution in units of whole channels. For most scientific applications we recommend using the *mode='velocity''* and *mode='frequency'* options, as it is easiest to determine what the resulting channel width will be in terms of velocity or frequency bandwidth. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "cvel(vis='test_w3oh_nohann.ms',\n",
    "     outputvis ='test_w3oh_nohann_cvellsrk.ms',\n",

    "The sign of the *width* parameter determines whether the channels run along increasing or decreasing values of frequency or velocity (i.e. if the cube is reversed or not).\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-info\">\n",
    "**Info:** in order to permit the calculation of velocities from the internally stored frequencies, you need to provide a rest frequency in parameter *restfreq* when you operate in mode \\'velocity\\'. This rest frequency will not be stored with the MS (as opposed to the rest frequency which you provide to the *clean* task which is subsequently stored with the image).\n",

    "The intent of **cvel** regridding is to transform channel labels and the visibilities to a spectral reference frame which is appropriate for the science analysis, e.g. from *TOPO* to *LSRK*, e.g. to correct for Doppler shifts throughout the time of the observation. Naturally, this will change the shape of the spectral features to some extent. According to the Nyquist theorem you should oversample a spectrum with twice the numbers of channels to retain the shape. Based on some tests, however, we recommend to observe with at least 3-4 times the number of channels for each significant spectral feature (like 3-4 channels per linewidth). This will minimize regridding artifacts in **cvel**.\n",
    "\n",
    "If **cvel** has already established the grid that is desired for the imaging, clean should be run with the default *channel* mode (*width=1*). This will avoid additional regridding in **clean**. Hanning smoothing is optionally offered in **cvel**, but tests have shown that already the regridding process itself, if it involved a transformation from *TOPO* to a non-terrestrial reference frame, implies some smoothing (due to channel interpolation) such that Hanning smoothing may not be necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "The interpolation method **fftshift** calculates the transformed visibilities by applying a FFT, then a phase ramp, and then an inverse FFT. Note that if you want to use this interpolation method, your frequency grid needs to be equidistant, i.e. it only works in mode velocity with *veltype=radio*, in mode frequency, and in mode channel (in the latter only if the input grid is itself equidistant in frequency). Note also that, as opposed to all other interpolation methods, this method will apply a constant (frequency-independent) shift in frequency which is not fully correct in the case of large fractional bandwidth of the given spectral window.\n",
    "\n",
    "The task **cvel** can also be used to transform spectral windows into the rest frame of the ephemeris object by setting the parameter *outframe* to \"SOURCE\" as in the following example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "cvel(vis='europa.ms', outputvis='cvel_europa.ms', outframe='SOURCE')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will make **cvel** perform a transformation to the GEO reference frame followed by an additional Doppler correction for the radial velocity given by the ephemeris for the each field. (Typically, this should happen after calibration and after splitting out the spectral widows and the target of interest). The result is an MS with a single combined spectral window in reference frame REST. From this frame, further transformations to other reference frames are not possible."
