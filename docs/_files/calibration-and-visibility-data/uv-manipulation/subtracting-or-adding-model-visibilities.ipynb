    "**uvsub** is a simple task that allows one to subtract or add the MODEL_DATA column to the CORRECTED_DATA column of a given MeasurementSet. It has only 2 parameters: *vis* and *reverse.*\n",
    "\n",
    "If the CORRECTED_DATA column does not exist then it will be created first and the DATA column will be copied into it before the addition/subtraction of the MODEL_DATA is performed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The MODEL_DATA column can either be the scratch column or a virtual one; either one will work with **uvsub**. The model visibilities are usually populated by the tasks **clean**/**tclean**, **ft**, and **setjy***.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that **uvsub** does the subtraction over the whole ms. If only a subsection (say *field* or *spw* selection was done whiile using **clean** or **ft**) of the MS was used in these tasks that populate the model visibilities, then the **uvsub** operation will give the expected results for only those parts. The remainder of the MS will get the CORRECTED_DATA added/subtracted with whatever existed originally in the MODEL_DATA. On initialization the model visbilities are 1 for parallel hand and 0 for cross hand."
