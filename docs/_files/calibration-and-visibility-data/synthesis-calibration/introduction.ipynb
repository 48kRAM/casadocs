    "    to turn on or off various features, contain important values (such\n",
    "    as flux densities), or list what should be done to the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "At its most basic level, Calibration in CASA is the process of taking\n",
    "\\\"uncalibrated\\\" **data**, setting up the operation of calibration tasks\n",
    "using **task parameters**, solving for new **calibration tables**, and\n",
    "then applying the calibration tables to form \\\"calibrated\\\" **data**. \n",
    "Iteration can occur as necessary, e.g., to re-solve for an eariler\n",
    "**calibration table** using a better set of prior calibration, often\n",
    "with the aid of other non-calibration steps (e.g. imaging to generate\n",
    "improved source models for \\\"self-calibration\\\").\n",

    "The calibration tables are the currency that is exchanged between the\n",
