    "are described under each parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "All lists of basic selection\n",
    "specification-units are comma separated lists and can be of any length.\n",
    "White-spaces before and after the commas (e.g. *’3C286, 3C48, 3C84’*) are ignored, while white-space within\n",
    "sub-strings is treated as part of the sub-string (e.g.* **’3C286, VIRGO A, 3C84’*). In some cases, spaces need to be quoted,\n",
    "e.g. *\"’spw 1’\"* (note the double quote around the single\n",

    "All integers can be of any length (in terms\n",
