    "The *multisource* parameter determines whether the UV FITS file is a multi-source file or a single-source file, if you have a single-source MS or choose only a single source. Note: the difference between a single-source and multi-source UVFITS file here is whether it has a source (SU) table and the source ID in the random parameters. Some programs (e.g. difmap) only accept single-source files. If you select more than one source in fields, then the *multisource* parameter will be overridden to be *True* regardless.\n",
    "\n",
    "The *combinespw* parameter allows, if some conditions are met, exporting of all spectral windows (SpW) as a set of \\\"IF\\\"s in a single \\\"FREQID\\\" setup instead of giving each SpW its own FREQID in the FITS file. In this context an IF (Intermediate Frequency) is a specialization of an SpW, where each IF in a UV FITS file must have the same number of channels and polarizations, each channel must have the same width, and each IF must be present (even if flagged) throughout the entire observation. If these conditions are not met the data must be exported using multiple FREQIDs, the UV FITS equivalent of a general SpW. This matters since many (sub)programs will work with multiple IFs, but not multiple FREQIDs. For example, a UV FITS file with multiple FREQIDs can be read by AIPS, but you may find that you have to separate the FREQIDs with SPLIT before you can do very much with them. Therefore *combinespw* should be *True* if possible. Typically MSes where each band was observed simultaneously can be exported with *combinespw=True*. MSes where the tuning changed with time, e.g. 10 minutes at 4.8 GHz followed by 15 minutes at 8.4 GHz, should be exported to multiple UV FITS files using *spw* to select one tuning (set of simultaneous SpWs) per file.\n",
