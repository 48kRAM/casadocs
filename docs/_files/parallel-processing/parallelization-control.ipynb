    "multi-node case, the following requirements are necessary for all nodes\n",

    "-   Password-less ssh access from the client (user) machine into all the\n",

    " The main library used in CASA (4.4+)\n",
    "to achieve parallelization is the Message Passing Interface (MPI) and in\n",
    "particular the [OpenMPI](http://www.open-mpi.de/ \"OpenMPI\")\n",
    "implementation. MPI is already included in the CASA distribution so that\n",
    "users do not need to install it. The CASA distribution comes with a\n",
    "wrapper of the MPI executor, which is called *mpicasa*. This wrapper does several settings behind\n",
    "the scenes in order to properly configure the environment to run CASA in\n",
    "parallel.\n",
    "\n",
    "The collection of CASA processes which\n",
    "will run the jobs from parallelized tasks, is set up via *mpicasa*. The simplest example is to run CASA in\n",
    "parallel on the *localhost* using the available cores in the machine. A\n",
    "typical example would be to run CASA on a desktop with 16 cores such as\n",
    "the following example:\n",
    "\n",
    "path_to_casa/mpicasa -n 16 path_to_casa/casa \\<casa_options\\>\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  *mpicasa*:\n",
    "    Wrapper around *mpirun*, which can be found in the casa\n",
    "    installation directory. Example:\n",
    "    /home/user/casa-release-4.5.0-el6/bin\n",
    "2.  *-n* : MPI\n",
    "    option to get the number of processes to run.\n",
    "3.  *16*: The\n",
    "    number of cores to be used in the localhost machine.\n",
    "    NOTE: MPI uses one process as the MPI Client,\n",
    "    which is where the user will see messages printed in the terminal or\n",
    "    in the logger. The other processes are used for the parallel work\n",
    "    and are called MPI Servers. Because of this, usually we give\n",
    "    number_of_processes + 1.\n",
    "4.  *casa*:\n",
    "    Full path to the CASA executable, *casa*.\n",

    "picked from one of those different versions instead of the\n",
    "\"path_to_casa/casa\" version that we want to run. This is typically the\n",
    "case in data reduction clusters where either the default environment or\n",
    "user setup scripts set the PATH to point to the latest release of CASA,\n",
    "for example. In such cases, it is safer to make sure in advance that the\n",

    "will be deployed (including the MPI Client). If the processing requires\n",
