A typical calibration cascade will work normally in parallel when it sees an input MMS. In order to do that, the first step is to set *createmms=True* inside **importasdm** to create a Multi-MS. Once that is done, the calibration steps will distribute the processing in parallel if CASA is started with **mpicasa**, or in serial otherwise.\n",

    "The Rflag action=\\'calculate\\' can be used to produce the frequency and time thresholds in a first pass which can then be applied in a second pass, using action=\\'apply\\' once or several times. When this is done with the Multi-MS structure the thresholds calculated in the first pass might differ from the thresholds that would be calculated using a single MS structure. This is due to the fact that in the Multi-MS structure the data are partitioned into Sub-MSs. The default is to produce a balanced partition with respect to the SPWs and scans, with the aim to get content from all SPWs and scans into each of the Sub-MSs. For this reason, the statistics calculated by RFlag may differ across Sub-MSs, as they would differ for different data selections. At the moment this issue has not been assessed thoroughly for real-world datasets. A related question that is not understood in detail at the moment, and that can affect both serial and parallel runs of RFlag, is how much the thresholds can differ between the single pass and dual pass modes of RFlag."
