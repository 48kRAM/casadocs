    "The CASA parallelization framework, *mpi4casa* was developed as a layer on top of MPI using a client-server model. The Client is the master process, driving user interaction, and dispatching user commands to the servers. Servers are all the other processes, running in the background, waiting for commands sent from the client side.\n",
    "\n",
    "One use-case of *mpi4casa* is to run CASA in parallel on a Multi-MS, as explained in previous chapters. There are other ways to process the data in parallel using *mpi4casa* without the need to create a Multi-MS. For instance, advanced users can benefit from the *mpi4casa* implementation to run multiple task commands in different cores or nodes.\n",
