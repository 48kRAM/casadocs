A Multi-MS can be handled like a normal \"monolithic\" MS. It can be moved and renamed like any other directory. CASA tasks that are not MMS-aware can process it like a monolithic MS.\n",

All subsequent Sub-MSs also contain links to the sub-tables of the first Sub-MS, except for the SOURCE and HISTORY sub-tables.

Note that if *numsubms=\\'auto\\'*, the task will try to create as many Sub-MSs as the number of available parallel cores used when starting CASA with *mpicasa*.
