    "Data is handled in CASA via the table system. In particular, visibility data are stored in a CASA table known as a MeasurementSet (MS). Details of the physical and logical MS structure are given below, but for our purposes here an MS is just a construct that contains the data. An MS can also store single dish data (as an auto-correlation-only data set), see \\\"[Single-dish data calibration and reduction](https://casa.nrao.edu/casadocs-devel/stable/calibration-and-visibility-data/single-dish-calibration/single-dish-data-calibration-and-reduction)\\\".\n",
