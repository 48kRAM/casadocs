    "SD task: imaging for total power and spectral data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **tsdimaging** task grids/images total power and spectral data\n",
    "according to a specified gridding kernel. The input data should be\n",
    "calibrated and bandpass corrected (where necessary), and the output is a\n",
    "CASA image format dataset, either 2-D, 3-D, or 4-D depending on the\n",
    "input parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "The output image contains up to four axes: two spatial axes, frequency,\n",
    "and polarization. By default, the spatial coordinates are determined\n",
    "such that the imaged area is covered with a cell size equal to 1/3 of\n",
    "the FWHM of the primary beam of antennas in the first MS. It is also\n",
    "possible to define the spatial axes of the image by specifying the image\n",
    "center direction (*phasecenter*), the number of image pixels (*imsize*),\n",
    "and the pixel size (*cell*).\n",
    "\n",
    "The frequency coordinate of the image is defined by three parameters:\n",
    "the number of channels (*nchan*), the channel number/frequency/velocity\n",
    "of the first channel (*start*), and the channel width (*width*). The\n",
    "*start* and *width* parameters can be in units of 'channel' (use channel\n",
    "number), 'frequency' (e.g., 'GHz'), or 'velocity' (e.g., 'km/s'). By\n",
    "default, *nchan*, *start*, and *width* are set so that all selected\n",
    "spectral windows are covered with a channel width equal to the\n",
    "separation of the first two channels selected.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the polarization axis of the image is determined by the\n",
    "*stokes* parameter. For example, *stokes='XXYY'* produces an image cube\n",
    "with each plane containing the image of one of the polarizations, while\n",
    "*stokes='I'* produces a \"total intensity\", or Stokes I image.&nbsp;There\n",
    "is also another option for Stokes I imaging, called 'pseudoI'; the\n",
    "difference between 'I' and 'pseudoI' is how the task handles flag\n",
    "information. The *stokes='I'* imaging is stricter in the sense that it\n",
    "only takes into account&nbsp;visibilities for which all correlations are\n",
    "valid. In other words, it excludes all correlations&nbsp;for any\n",
    "data&nbsp;with any correlation flagged,&nbsp;even though the remaining\n",
    "correlations are valid.&nbsp;On the other hand, the 'pseudoI' option\n",
    "allows Stokes I images to include data for which either of the parallel\n",
    "hand data are unflagged.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE**: Users should set *stokes='pseudoI'* if you want to get the\n",
    "equivalent result to the one obtained by setting *stokes='I'* for\n",
    "**sdimaging**. Setting *stokes='I'* in **sdimaging** is implemented the\n",
    "same way as *stokes='pseudoI'* in **tsdimaging**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The parameter *gridfunction* sets the gridding function (convolution\n",
    "kernel) for imaging. Currently, the task supports 'BOX' (boxcar), 'SF'\n",
    "(Prolate Spheroidal Wave Function), 'GAUSS' (Gaussian), 'GJINC'\n",
    "(Gaussian\\*Jinc), where Jinc(x) = $J_1(π*x/c)/(π*x/c)$ with a first order\n",
    "Bessel function J_1, and 'PB' (Primary Beam).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are four subparameters for *gridfunction*: *convsupport, truncate,\n",
    "gwidth*, and *jwidth*. The *convsupport* parameter is an integer\n",
    "specifying the cutoff radius for 'SF' in units of pixels. By default\n",
    "(*convsupport*=-1), the cutoff radius is 3 pixels. The *truncate*\n",
    "parameter is a cutoff radius for 'GAUSS' or 'GJINC'. It accepts integer,\n",
    "float, and string values, where the string would be a number plus unit.\n",
    "Allowed units include 'deg', 'arcmin', 'arcsec', and 'pixel'. The\n",
    "default is 'pixel'. The default value for *truncate*, which is used when\n",
    "a negative radius is set, is 3\\*HWHM for 'GAUSS' and the radius at the\n",
    "first null for 'GJINC'. The *gwidth* is the HWHM of the Gaussian for\n",
    "'GAUSS' and 'GJINC'. The default value is $sqrt(log(2))$ pixels for 'GAUSS' and\n",
    "$2.52*sqrt(log(2))$ pixels for 'GJINC'.\n",
    "The *jwidth* specifies the width of the jinc function (parameter 'c' in\n",
    "the definition above). The default is 1.55 pixels. Both *gwidth* and\n",
    "*jwidth* allow integer, float, or string values, where the string would\n",
    "be a number plus unit. The default values for *gwidth* and *jwidth* are\n",
    "taken from Mangum, et al. 2007\n",
    "<a href=\"#cit1\" id=\"ref-cit1\" class=\"ref-cit\">[1]</a> . The formula for\n",
    "'GAUSS' and 'GJINC' are taken from Table 1 in the paper, and are written\n",
    "as follows using *gwidth* and *jwidth*:\n",
    "\n",
    "GAUSS: $\\exp[-\\log(2)*(|r|/gwidth)^2]$,\n",
    "\n",
    "GJINC: $J_1(π*|r|/jwidth)/(π*|r|/jwidth)* \\exp[-\\log(2)*(|r|/gwidth)^2]$,\n",
    "\n",

    "is&nbsp;the radial distance from the origin.&nbsp;\n",
    "\n",
    "The *outfile* should be unique. **tsdimaging**&nbsp;will stop with an\n",
    "Exception error (e.g., Exception: Unable to open lattice) if *outfile*\n",
    "is the same as the *infiles* name.\n",
    "\n",
    "The *phasecenter* parameter sets the center direction of the image. If\n",
    "the phasecenter is the name known major solar system object ('MERCURY',\n",

    "phasecenter='TRACKFIELD', which will use the ephemerides or polynomial\n",
    "phasecenter in the FIELD table of the MeasurementSets as the source\n",
    "center to track.\n",
    "\n",
    "The *clipminmax* function can clip minimum and maximum values from each\n",
    "pixel. This function makes the computed output slightly more robust to\n",
    "noise and spurious data. Note that the benefit of clipping is lost when\n",
    "the number of integrations contributing to each gridded pixel is small,\n",
    "or where the incidence of spurious data points is approximately equal to\n",
    "or greater than the number of beams (in area) encompassed by the\n",
