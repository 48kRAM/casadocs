    "Task **sdfixscan** is used to remove a striping pattern generated along\n",
    "the scan direction in raster scan data. By default, the scanning noise\n",
    "is removed using the FFT-based 'Basket-Weaving' method\n",
    "<a href=\"#cit1\" id=\"ref-cit1\" class=\"ref-cit\">[1]</a> that requires\n",
    "multiple images observed over exactly the same area with a different\n",
    "scanning direction. When doing 'Basket-Weaving', you can mask small\n",
    "structures and protect them using the *maskwidth* parameter. If only one\n",
    "image is available, the 'Pressed-out' method\n",
    "<a href=\"#cit2\" id=\"ref-cit2\" class=\"ref-cit\">[2]</a> can be used to\n",
    "remove the scanning effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "For 'Basket-Weaving', scans must have been conducted in at least two\n",
    "different directions. Normally, the scanning direction should be\n",
    "specified for each input image.&nbsp;As *direction* parameters, you\n",
    "should specify the angles perpendicular to the scan directions&nbsp;in\n",
    "units of degrees.&nbsp;The angle is defined in the counterclockwise\n",
    "direction from the x-axis.&nbsp;It removes scan noise by masking wave\n",
    "components perpendicular to the scan direction in the Fourier domain.\n",
    "Scan noise and striation structures appear as band-like artifacts in the\n",
    "Fourier transformed data. The parameter *maskwidth* controls the width\n",
    "of the mask in Fourier space and is defined as a percentage in the\n",
    "Fourier domain (*maskwidth = 10* means masking a region of 10% width in\n",
    "Fourier space). In the perfect case, where scan noise is an ideal\n",
    "striation without structure in the direction perpendicular to scan\n",
    "direction, the scan noise can be removed by specifying a small value for\n",
    "*maskwidth* (ex. *maskwidth = 1*). In the actual case, *maskwidth*\n",
    "should be set to some larger number, since scan noise also has some\n",
    "structure in the direction perpendicular to the scanning direction.\n",
    "Larger *maskwidth* values may also remove the emission from the\n",
    "scientific target at the same time, so careful adjustment and\n",
    "characterization by the user is necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE**: Such masks are applied for each input scan image and the\n",
    "combined image is returned. If the size of the mask is large, the\n",
    "improvements to the noise level by combining images becomes small, since\n",
    "a smaller amount of data is subject to the processing.&nbsp;And note\n",
    "that 'Basket-Weaving' mode supports combining orthogonal scan noise\n",
    "images only (It is possible, but,&nbsp;at least, this function has not\n",
    "been tested enough).\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;For 'Pressed-out', the scanning must be in a single direction.\n",
    "There are&nbsp;two ways to specify the size of the smoothing beam used\n",
    "for this process. One&nbsp;is to specify smoothing size directly. To do\n",
    "this, *smoothsize* should&nbsp;be specified as a string of a numerical\n",
    "value and a unit&nbsp;(e.g. '10.0arcsec'). The value of *beamsize* will\n",
    "be ignored in this case. The other way is to set smoothing size as a\n",
    "scale factor of the observed beam&nbsp;size. In this case, *beamsize* is\n",
    "interpreted as the observed beam&nbsp;size, and *smoothsize* is the\n",
    "scale factor. If the *beamsize* is&nbsp;provided as a float value, its\n",
    "unit is assumed to 'arcsec'. It is also&nbsp;possible to set the\n",
    "*beamsize* as a string consisting of the numerical&nbsp;value and the\n",
    "unit. The *smoothsize* must be a float value.\n",
    "\n",
    "The *infiles* must be an image (CASA or FITS), and does&nbsp;not work\n",
    "with MS or Scantable. The *direction* is an angle with respect&nbsp;to\n",
    "horizontal, in units of degrees. Preferred entries should range from 0.0\n",
    "to 180.0 degrees. The *tmax* and the *tmin* parameters are used to\n",
    "specify a threshold that&nbsp;defines a range of spectral values used\n",
    "for processing. Data values larger than *tmax* or smaller than *tmin*\n",
    "will be&nbsp;excluded from the processing. The default (0.0) is to apply\n",
    "no threshold.&nbsp;The *outfile* specifies an output CASA image name. If\n",
    "*outfile* is&nbsp;empty, the default name ('sdfixscan.out.im') will be\n",
    "used.\n",
