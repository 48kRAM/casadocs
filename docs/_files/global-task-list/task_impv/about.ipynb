    "impv task: Construct a position-velocity image by choosing two points in\n",
    "the direction plane.\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a position-velocity image. The way the slice is specified is\n",
    "controlled by the *mode* parameter. When *mode=\"coords\"*, start and end\n",
    "are used to specify the points between which slice is taken in the\n",
    "direction coordinate. If *mode=\"length\",* *center, pa (position angle),*\n",
    "and *length* are used to specify the slice. Note that impv will treat\n",
    "any string starting with \"c\" as *\"coords\"* and any string starting with\n",
    "\"l\" as *\"length\".* The spectral extent of the resulting image will be\n",
    "that provided by the *region* specification or the entire spectral range\n",
    "of the input image if no *region* is specified. One may not specify a\n",
    "*region* in direction space; that is accomplished by specifying the\n",
    "slice as described previously.\n",
    "\n",
    "The parameters *start* and *end* may be specified as two element arrays\n",
    "of numerical values, in which case these values will be interpreted as\n",
    "pixel locations in the input image. Alternatively, they may be expressed\n",
    "as arrays of two strings each representing the direction. These strings\n",
    "can either represent quantities (e.g. \\[\"40.5deg\", \"0.5rad\") or be\n",
    "sexigesimal format (e.g. \\[\"14h20m20.5s\",\"-30d45m25.4s\"\\],\n",
    "\\[\"14:20:20.5s\",\"-30.45.25.4\"\\]). In addition, they may be expressed as\n",
    "a single string containing the longitude-like and latitude-like values\n",
    "and optionally a reference frame value, e.g. \"J2000 14:20:20.5s\n",
    "-30.45.25.4\".The *center* parameter can be specified in the same way.\n",
    "The *length* parameter may be specified as a single numerical value, in\n",
    "which case it is interpreted as the length in pixels, or a valid\n",
    "quantity, in which case it must have units conformant with the direction\n",
    "axes units. The *pa* (position angle) parameter must be specified as a\n",
    "valid quantity with angular units. The position angle is interpreted in\n",
    "the usual astronomical sense; e.g. measured from north through east in\n",
    "an equatorial coordinate system. The slice in this case starts at the\n",
    "specified position angle and ends on the opposite side of the specified\n",
    "center. Thus *pa=\"45deg\"* means start at a point at a *pa* of 45 degrees\n",
    "relative to the specified center and end at a point at a *pa* of\n",
    "225Â degrees relative to the center. Either *start/end* or\n",
    "*center/pa/length* must be specified; if a parameter from one of these\n",
    "sets is specified, a parameter from the other set may not be specified.\n",
    "In either case, the *end* points of the segment must fall within the\n",
    "input image, and they both must be at least 2 pixels from the edge of\n",
    "the input image to facilite rotation (see below).\n",
    "\n",
    "One may specify a *width*, which represents the number of pixels\n",
    "centered along and perpendicular to the direction slice that are used\n",
    "for averaging along the slice. The *width* may be specified as an\n",
    "integer, in which case it must be positive and odd. Alternatively, it\n",
    "may be specified as a valid quantity string (e.g., \"4arcsec\") or\n",
    "quantity record (e.g. qa.quantity(\"4arcsec\")). In this case, units must\n",
    "be conformant to the direction axes units (usually angular units) and\n",
    "the specified quantity will be rounded up, if necessary, to the next\n",
    "highest equivalent odd integer number of pixels. The default value of 1\n",
    "represents no averaging. A value of 3 means average one pixel on each\n",
    "side of the slice and the pixel on the slice. Note that this *width* is\n",
    "applied to pixels in the image after it has been rotated (see below for\n",
    "a description of how rotation is applied).  \n",
    "  \n",
    "One may specify the *unit* for the angular offset axis.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "Internally, the image is first rotated, padding if necessary to include\n",
    "relevant pixels that would otherwise be excluded by the rotation\n",
    "operation, so that the slice is horizontal, with the starting pixel left\n",
    "of the ending pixel. Then, the pixels within the specified width of the\n",
    "slice are averaged and the resulting image is written and/or returned.\n",
    "The output image has a linear coordinate in place of the direction\n",
    "coordinate of the input image, and the corresponding axis represents\n",
    "angular offset with the center pixel having a value of 0.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "The equivalent coordinate system, with a (usually) rotated direction\n",
    "coordinate (e.g., RA and Dec) is written to the output image as a table\n",
    "record. It can be retrieved using the table tool (see the examples tab,\n",
    "which is linked from the top of this page).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that because the ouput image does not have a direction coordinate,\n",
    "other image analysis tasks and tool methods may not be able to process\n",
    "it correctly if it is used as an input image. In such cases when\n",
    "possible, the task or tool method in question should be first run on the\n",
    "input image that would have been used in impv, and then impv should be\n",
    "run using as the input image, the output image from the task or tool\n",
    "method in question. That is, the output image of impv should normally be\n",
    "considered to be the end point of any image analysis sequence for\n",
    "tasks/tool methods."
