    "With the default settings, this task will\n",
    "produce FITS image files with 4 dimensions:&nbsp; RA, Dec, radio\n",
    "frequency, and polarization (Stokes parameters).&nbsp; Several options\n",
    "influence the shape of the output data array.&nbsp; Setting\n",
    "*dropstokes=True* will cause the polarization axis to be omitted.&nbsp;\n",
    "Setting *velocity=True* will cause the spectral axis to have units of\n",
    "velocity rather than frequency.&nbsp; Setting *stokeslast=False* will\n",
    "interchange the order of the polarization and spectral axes (i.e,\n",
    "polarization will be the third dimension, and frequency the\n",
    "fourth).&nbsp; Finally, setting *dropdeg=True* will cause any\n",
    "\"degenerate\" axes, those with length 1, to be omitted.&nbsp; For example\n",

    "single precision floating point, respectively. We recommend using the\n",
    "default value -32 in most cases. Using 16 bits results in smaller FITS\n",
    "files, at the expense of dynamic range in the image.&nbsp; It may also\n",
