    "the raw bandpass is likely to return complicated results that are\n",
    "difficult to parse meaningfully. It's therefore recommended to run\n",

    "functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The masks for fitting (i.e. selection of the fitting ranges) can be\n",
    "computed automatically, or provided specifically by the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE**: Multiple scans, IFs, and polarizations can in principle be\n",
    "handled, but it is recommended to use *scan*, *field*, *spw*, and\n",
    "*pol*&nbsp;to give a single selection for each fit.&nbsp;The task\n",
    "produces a Python dictionary of line statistics as output, with keys:\n",
