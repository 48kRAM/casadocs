    "\n",
    "1.  Imaging = fitting a polynomial to a noisy spectrum\n",
    "    (with weights).&nbsp;The polynomial\n",
    "    represents $I_{\\nu}$ x $P_{\\nu}$,\n",
    "    where $I_{\\nu}$ is the intensity and $P_{\\nu}$ the\n",
    "    primary beam (PB) at frequency $\\nu$.  \n",
    "2.  PB model = fitting a polynomial to a collection of\n",
    "    PBs at different&nbsp;frequencies (with\n",
    "    weights). The polynomial represents the primary beam $P_{\\nu}$.\n",
    "3.  Dividing the two polynomials via their\n",
    "    coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps (1) and (2) need to be consistent with each other\n",
    "(with respect to&nbsp;frequencies used&nbsp;and their weights) to produce\n",
    "FITS that when divided give exactly only the sky parameters.&nbsp;Unless you\n",
    "use the same math (and code) for both, they won't be exactly\n",
    "consistent.&nbsp;The way to minimize differences\n",
    "is to choose a list of frequencies (via spws/chans)&nbsp;and weights for **widebandpbcor** that resemble the frequency\n",
    "structure of the data you&nbsp;have used for\n",
    "imaging.&nbsp;For example, if you have 3 spws in\n",
    "your data and the middle spw has a factor of 10&nbsp;less weight\n",
    "in the data, then using just one channel each from the two outer spws\n",
    "for&nbsp;the PB modeling may be close\n",
    "enough to using all 3 spws. Or, you could also pick&nbsp;the middle\n",
