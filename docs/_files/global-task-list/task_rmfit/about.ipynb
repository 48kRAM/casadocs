    "rmfit task: Calculate rotation measure.\n",
    "\n",
    "This task generates the rotation measure (RM) image from stokes Q and U\n",
    "measurements at several different frequencies. You are required to\n",
    "specify the name of at least one image with a polarization axis\n",
    "containing Stokes Q and U planes and with a frequency axis containing\n",
    "more than two channels. The frequencies do not have to be equally spaced\n",
    "(i.e., the frequency coordinate can be a tabular coordinate).&nbsp;The\n",
    "task will work out the position angle images for you. You may also\n",
    "specify multiple image names, in which case these images will first be\n",
    "concatenated along the spectral axis using **ia.imageconcat**. The\n",
    "requirements are that for all images, the axis order must be the same\n",
    "and the number of pixels along each axis must be identical, except for\n",
    "the spectral axis which may differ in length between images. The\n",
    "spectral axis need not be contiguous from one image to another.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rotation measure algorithms that work robustly are few. The main problem\n",
    "is in trying to account for the n-pi ambiguity\n",
    "<a href=\"#cit1\" id=\"ref-cit1\" class=\"ref-cit\">[1]</a> .\n",
    "\n",
    "This task uses the algorithm published in Appendix A.1 of&nbsp;Leahy et\n",
    "al. <a href=\"#cit1\" id=\"ref-cit1\" class=\"ref-cit\">[1]</a> But as in all\n",
    "these algorithms, the basic process is that for each spatial pixel, the\n",
    "position angle vs frequency data is fit to determine the rotation\n",
    "measure and the position angle at zero wavelength (and associated\n",
    "errors). An image containing the number of n-pi turns that were added to\n",
    "the data at each spatial pixel and for which the best fit was found can\n",
    "be written. The reduced chi-squared image for the fits can also be\n",
    "written.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that no assessment of curvature (i.e., deviation from the simple\n",
    "linear position angle - lambda<sup>2</sup> functional form) is made.\n",
    "\n",
    "Any combination of output images can be written.\n",
    "\n",
    "The parameter *sigma* gives the thermal noise in Stokes Q and U. By\n",
    "default it is determined automatically using the image data. But if it\n",
    "proves to be inaccurate (maybe not many signal-free pixels), it may be\n",
    "specified. This is used for calculating the error in the position angles\n",
    "(via propagation of Gaussian errors).\n",
    "\n",
    "The *maxpaerr* parameter specifies the maximum allowable error in the\n",
    "position angle that is acceptable. The default is an infinite value.\n",
    "From the standard propagation of errors, the error in the linearly\n",
    "polarized position angle is determined from the Stokes Q and U images\n",
    "(at each directional pixel for each frequency). If the position angle\n",
    "error for any pixel exceeds the specified value, the position angle at\n",
    "that pixel is omitted from the fit. The process generates an error for\n",
    "the fit and this is used to compute the errors in the output images.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that *maxpaerr* is not used to mask pixels in the output images.\n",
    "\n",
    "The *rmfg* parameter is used to specify a foreground RM value. For\n",
    "example, you may know the mean RM in some direction out of the Galaxy,\n",
    "then including this can improve the algorithm by reducing ambiguity.\n",
    "\n",
    "The parameter *rmmax* specifies the maximum absolute RM value that\n",
    "should be solved for. This is quite an important parameter. The default\n",
    "value, 0, indicates no ambiguity handling will be used. So some apriori\n",
    "information should be supplied; this is the basic problem with rotation\n",
    "measure algorithms.\n",
