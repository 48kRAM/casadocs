    "This task provides for initialization of the weight information in the\n",
    "MS. An overview on weights in CASA is provided in the [Data\n",
    "Weights](https://casa.nrao.edu/casadocs-devel/stable/calibration-and-visibility-data/data-weights)\n",
    "section of CASAdocs. For ALMA interferometry and EVLA data, it should\n",
    "not&nbsp;generally be necessary to use this task, as the weight\n",
    "information&nbsp;should have been initialized properly at fill time\n",
    "(when the import was performed with CASA v4.2.2 and later).\n",
    "\n",
    "Several initialization modes are supported via the *wtmode* parameter.\n",
    "If *wtmode='nyq'* (the default), the SIGMA and WEIGHT will\n",
    "be&nbsp;initialized according to bandwidth and integration time.\n",
    "This&nbsp;is the theoretically correct mode for raw normalized\n",
    "visibilities&nbsp;(e.g., ALMA). For the EVLA, this is correct if\n",
    "switched-power&nbsp;and bandpass calibration will later be applied. If\n",
    "*wtmode='sigma'*, WEIGHT will be initialized according to\n",
    "the&nbsp;existing SIGMA column. If *wtmode='weight'*, WEIGHT_SPECTRUM\n",
    "will be initialized according&nbsp;to the existing WEIGHT column;\n",
    "*dowtspec=True* must be specified in&nbsp;this case. If *wtmode='ones'*,\n",
    "SIGMA and WEIGHT will be initialized with 1.0,&nbsp;globally. This is a\n",
    "traditional means of initializing weight&nbsp;information, and is\n",
    "adequate when the integration time and&nbsp;bandwidth are uniform. It is\n",
    "not recommended for modern&nbsp;instruments (ALMA, EVLA), where variety\n",
