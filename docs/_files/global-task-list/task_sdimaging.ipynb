    "\n",
    "This task grids/images total power and spectral data according to a\n",
    "specified gridding kernel. The input data should be calibrated and\n",
    "bandpass corrected (where necessary), and the output is a CASA image\n",

    "parameters.  \n",
    "&nbsp;\n",
    "\n",
    "The output image contains up to four axes: two spatial axes, frequency,\n",
    "and polarization. By default, the spatial coordinates are determined\n",
    "such that the imaged area is covered with a cell size equal to 1/3 of\n",
    "the FWHM of the primary beam of antennas in the first MS. It is also\n",
    "possible to define the spatial axes of the image by specifying the image\n",
    "center direction (*phasecenter*), the number of image pixels (*imsize*),\n",
    "and the pixel size (*cell*).\n",
    "\n",
    "  \n",
    "The frequency coordinate of the image is defined by three parameters:\n",
    "the number of channels (*nchan*), the channel number/frequency/velocity\n",
    "of the first channel (*start*), and the channel width (*width*).&nbsp;\n",
    "The *start* and *width* parameters can be in units of 'channel' (use\n",
    "channel number), 'frequency' (e.g., 'GHz'), or 'velocity' (e.g.,\n",
    "'km/s'). By default, *nchan*, *start*, and *width* are set so that all\n",
    "selected spectral windows are covered with a channel width equal to the\n",
    "separation of the first two channels selected.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "Finally, the polarization axis of the image is determined by the\n",
    "*stokes* parameter. For example, *stokes*='XXYY' produces an image cube\n",
    "with each plane containing the image of one of the polarizations, while\n",
    "stokes='I' produces a \"total intensity\", or Stokes I image.\n",

    "The parameter *gridfunction* sets the gridding function (convolution\n",

    "(*convsupport*=-1), the cutoff radius is 3 pixels. The *truncate*\n",

    "float, and string values, where the string would be a number plus unit.\n",
    "Allowed units include 'deg', 'arcmin', 'arcsec', and 'pixel'. The\n",
    "default is 'pixel'.&nbsp; The default value for *truncate*, which is\n",
    "used when a negative radius is set, is 3\\*HWHM for 'GAUSS', and the\n",
    "radius at the first null for 'GJINC'. The *gwidth* is the HWHM of the\n",
    "Gaussian for 'GAUSS' and 'GJINC'. The default value is sqrt(log(2))\n",
    "pixels for 'GAUSS' and 2.52\\*sqrt(log(2)) pixels for 'GJINC'. The\n",
    "*jwidth* specifies the width of the jinc function (parameter 'c' in the\n",
    "definition above). The default is 1.55 pixels. Both *gwidth* and\n",
    "*jwidth* allow integer, float, or string values, where the string would\n",
    "be a number plus unit.&nbsp; The default values for *gwidth* and\n",
    "*jwidth* are taken from Mangum, et al. 2007\n",
