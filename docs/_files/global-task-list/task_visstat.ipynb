    "median absolute deviation, first and third quartiles, minimum, maximum,\n",
    "variance, standard deviation, and root mean square. Two other fields\n",
    "indicate whether the data are weighted and whether they are masked. The\n",
    "field '*npts*' gives the number of data points.\n",

    "*'reportingaxes'* argument is used to partition the sample set along an\n",

    "For example, if *partitionaxes*='field', a list of fields is given, and\n",
    "some of the fields are completely flagged, the number of points reported\n",
