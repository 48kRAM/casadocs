    "\n",
    "The **importasdm** task will fill SDM1.2 and SDM1.3 format data into a\n",
    "CASA visibility data set (MS). The importasdm task supports all changes\n",
    "in the ALMA ASDM made since the previous CASA release (an up-to-date\n",
    "description of the most recent tables of the SDM can be found\n",
    "[here](https://casa.nrao.edu/casadocs-devel/stable/casa-fundamentals/the-science-data-model)).\n",
    "ALMA data were recorded in SDM1.2 format from October 2009 until May\n",
    "2011. Since May 2011, ALMA is using the SDM1.3 format. In particular,\n",
    "all science data from Cycle 0 onward will be in SDM1.3. The JVLA started\n",
    "using SDM1.2 in October 2009, but currently also uses SDM1.3. The\n",
    "**importasdm** task can read all of the above formats.  For the default\n",
    "parameter settings for **importasdm**, see the Examples tab.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic modes of importing data utilizing **importasdm** can be set by\n",
    "using various parameters.  For example,\n",
    "\n",
    "-   If the parameter *scans* is set, then **importasdm** processes only\n",
    "    the scans specified in the option’s value. This value is a\n",
    "    semicolon-separated list of scan specifications. A scan\n",
    "    specification consists in an execution (exec) block index followed\n",
    "    by the character ’:’ followed by a comma-separated list of scan\n",
    "    indices or scan index ranges. A scan index is relative to the exec\n",
    "    block it belongs to. Scan indices are 1-based while exec blocks are\n",
    "    0-based. The expressions:\n",
    "    -   \"0:1\"\n",
    "    -   \"2:2\\~6\"\n",
    "    -   \"0:1;1:2\\~6,8;2:,3:24\\~30\"\n",
    "    -   \"1,2\"\n",
    "    -   \"3:\"\n",
    "-   are all valid values for the selection. The \"3:\" selector will be\n",
    "    interpreted as ’all the scans of the exec block 3’. A scan index or\n",
    "    a scan index range not preceded by an exec block index will be\n",
    "    interpreted as ’all the scans with such indexes in all the exec\n",
    "    blocks’. By default, all the scans are considered.\n",
    "-   When *process_flags=True*, the task will create online flags based\n",
    "    on the Flag.xml, Antenna.xml and SpectralWindow.xml files and copy\n",
    "    them to the *FLAG_CMD* sub-table of the MS. The flags will NOT be\n",
    "    applied unless the parameter *applyflags* is set to True.\n",
    "    Optionally, the flags can also be saved to an external ASCII file if\n",
    "    *savecmds* is set to True. The flags can later be applied to the MS\n",
    "    using task **flagdata** in list mode.\n",
    "-   When *bdfflags=True*, the task will apply online flags contained in\n",
    "    the ASDM BDF data by calling the executable bdflags2MS\n",
    "    which the user can also do from the OS prompt. Setting\n",
    "    *bdfflags=True* is recommended for ALMA data.\n",
    "-   When *createmms=True*, the task will create a Multi-MS partitioned\n",
    "    according to the given separation axis. For more detailed\n",
    "    documentation on partition, Multi-MS, and the MPI use in CASA,\n",
    "    please see the global task list pages describing **partition**\n",
    "    and **mstransform**. [The\n",

    "    contains more information on Multi-MS creation. \n",
    "-   When setting the values for *wvr_corrected_data*, the task will read\n",
    "    the SDM binary data and fill the DATA column in the MAIN table of\n",
    "    the MS for those ALMA data that have either corrected data,\n",
    "    uncorrected data or both. Expected values for this option are 'no'\n",
    "    for the uncorrected data (this is the default), 'yes' for the\n",
    "    corrected data, and 'both' for corrected and uncorrected data. In\n",
    "    the latter case, two MeasurementSets are created, one containing the\n",

    "#### Import of ASDM data with option *lazy=True*\n",

    "**importasdm** will fill the visibilities into a newly created DATA\n",

    "1.  You must not delete your ASDM. You can, however, move it but you\n",
    "    have to update the reference stored in the MS. Symbolic links will\n",
    "    work. See below on how to use the tool method **ms.asdmref** to\n",
    "    manipulate the ASDM reference.\n",
    "2.  The lazily imported DATA/FLOAT_DATA column is read-only. But in any\n",
    "    normal data reduction, the DATA/FLOAT_DATA column (as opposed to\n",
    "    CORRECTED DATA) is treated as read-only anyway.\n",
    "\n",
    "The lazily imported MS is numerically identical with the traditionally\n",
    "imported MS and so are all results derived from the MSs. The setting\n",
    "*lazy=True* might be made the default setting in future CASA releases.\n",
    "An important additional tool to manipulate lazily imported MSs is the\n",
    "method **ms.asdmref** in the MS tool. If the MS is imported from an ASDM\n",
    "with option *lazy=True*, the DATA/FLOAT_DATA column of the MS is virtual\n",

    "*abspath*. When called with *abspath* equal to an empty string\n",
    "(default), the method just reports the currently set ASDM path or an\n",
    "empty string if the ASDM path was not set, i.e. the MS was not lazily\n",
    "imported. If you want to move the referenced ASDM to a different path,\n",
    "you can set the new absolute path by providing it as the value of\n",
    "*abspath* to the method.\n",
