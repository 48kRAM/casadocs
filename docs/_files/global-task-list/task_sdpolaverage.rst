      Task **sdpolaverage** is used to export Single Dish MS data
      averaged over different polarizations, to obtain Stokes I from
      orthogonal autocorrelation pairs (XXYY/LLRR).Â

      Two modes of polarizaton averaging are available. One is 'stokes'
      which is an average based on a formulation of Stokes parameter. In
      this mode, averaged data is calculated by (XX + YY) / 2 or (RR +
      LL) / 2. The other option is 'geometric', which is a conventional
      way of averaging in the field of single-dish data reduction; the
      output data is given by weighted average of XX and YY, or RR and
      LL.
