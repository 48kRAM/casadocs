    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI), fringe-fitting is an\n",
    "essential step which is not typically used for connected element arrays\n",
    "such as JVLA and ALMA. The very long baselines make observations\n",
    "particularly sensitive to small errors in the correlator model (station\n",
    "positions), signal chain, and the temporally- and spatially-variable\n",
    "atmosphere. The errors manifest themselves as residual delays (which\n",
    "introduce a slope when plotting phase against frequency) and delay-rates\n",
    "(which cause the phase offset at, say, the center of the band to drift\n",
    "as a function of time). Additionally at low frequencies and large\n",
    "fractional bandwidths a dispersive delay can be observed proportional\n",
    "(in time) to the inverse of the square of frequency and therefore\n",
    "proportional to the reciprocal of the frequency in phase. These errors\n",
    "can be corrected by observations of a bright calibrator source and a\n",
    "phase reference source which is close to the target source in projection\n",
    "on the sky.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "Prior to running **fringefit** it is recommended to calibrate the\n",
    "amplitudes, as the weights are used by **fringefit** to determine the\n",
    "reliability of the fringe detection. A tunable SNR-cutoff is implemented\n",
    "to allow weak fringes and non-detections to be discarded. Bandpass\n",

    "gain correction, it will be more efficient after fringe fitting when\n",

    "  \n",
    "The algorithm used in **fringefit**, based on the Schwab-Cotton\n",
    "algorithm (originally implemented in the AIPS task FRING), has two\n",

    "reference station separately and estimate the SNR value for each of\n",
    "these baselines using a Fast Fourier Transform. The fringes that pass\n",
    "the SNR requirement are passed through to the second step, a global\n",
    "least-squares solver that attempts to optimize the solutions and\n",
    "transform them into antenna-based solutions for phase, delay, rate and\n",

    "excluded in the solution at this phase using the *paramactive* keyword\n",
