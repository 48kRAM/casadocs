    "### CHAUVENET\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea behind this algorithm is to eliminate outliers based on a\n",
    "maximum *z-score* parameter value. A *z-score* is the number of standard\n",
    "deviations a point is from the mean of a distribution. This method thus\n",
    "is meant to be used for (nearly) normal distributions. In general, this\n",
    "is an iterative process, with successive iterations discarding\n",
    "additional outliers as the remaining points become closer to forming a\n",
    "normal distribution. Iterating stops when no additional points lie\n",
    "beyond the specified *z-score* value, or, if *z-score* is negative, when\n",
    "Chauvenet's criterion is met (see below). The parameter *maxiter* can be\n",
    "set to a non-negative value to prematurely abort this iterative process.\n",
    "When *verbose=T*, the \"N-iter\" column in the table that is logged\n",
    "represents the number of iterations that were executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chauvenet's criterion allows the target *z-score* to decrease as the\n",
    "number of points in the distribution decreases on subsequent iterations.\n",
    "Essentially, the criterion is that the probability of having one point\n",
    "in a normal distribution at a maximum *z-score* of z<sub>max</sub> must\n",
    "be at least 0.5. z<sub>max</sub> is therefore a function of (only) the\n",

    "2.  The image does not have a intensity-like brightness unit. Examples\n",
    "    of such units are Jy/beam (in which case the image must also have a\n",
    "    beam) and Kelvin (K)\n",
    "3.  There are no direction axes in the cursor axes that are used\n",
    "4.  If the (specified region of the) image has a non-degenerate spectral\n",
