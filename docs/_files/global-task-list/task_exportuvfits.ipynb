    "transfer data from CASA to AIPS, but it also serves the UVFITS format\n",
    "used in other software packages (e.g., MIRIAD). A UVFITS file is written\n",
    "in floating point format. **exportuvfits** accepts a number of\n",
    "parameters that can control what is written out (see e.g. the *spw*,\n",
