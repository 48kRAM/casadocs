    "This task can flag a MeasurementSet or a calibration table. It has two\n",
    "main types of operation. One type will read the parameters from the\n",
    "interface and flag using any of the various available modes. The other\n",
    "type will read the commands from a text file, a list of files or a\n",
    "Python list of strings, containing a list of flag commands (each line\n",
    "containing data selection parameters and any parameter specific for the\n",
    "mode being requested). Please see examples at the end of this help.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also possible to only save the parameters set in the interface\n",
    "without flagging. The parameters can be saved in the FLAG_CMD sub-table\n",
    "or in a text file. Note that when saving to an external file, the\n",
    "parameters will be appended to the given file.\n",
    "\n",
    "The available flagging modes are: 'manual', 'clip', 'shadow', 'quack',\n",
    "'elevation', 'tfcrop', 'rflag', 'extend', 'unflag' and 'summary'. For\n",
    "automatic flagging, it is recommended to combine auto-flag modes with\n",
