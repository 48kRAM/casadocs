Enter the text into the \"I*nsert Message*\" box at the bottom of the logger, and click on the *Add* (+) button, or choose to enter a longer message. The entered message will appear with a priority of \"*NOTE*\" with the Origin as your username. See Figure [below](http://casa.nrao.edu/casadocs/stable/usingcasa/casa-logger#figid-loggerfiginsert) for an example.\n",
