    "The modular version of CASA behaves like a standard Python package and user scripts should include the relevant modules as they would any other python module (i.e. numpy).  Executing external user scripts with modular CASA is just like any other python application.  Note we recommend running in a Python venv, see the [installation instructions](https://casa.nrao.edu/casadocs-devel/stable/usingcasa/obtaining-and-installing) for more information.\n",

    "\n",
    "Since the full CASA installation from a tar file includes its own python environment that is (typically) not called directly, alternative methods of feeding in user scripts are necessary.  There are three main standard Python ways of executing external user scripts in the full installation of CASA:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  -c startup parameter (see configuration instructions)\n",
    "2.  exec(open(\\\"./filename\\\").read()) within the CASA Python environment\n",
    "3.  add your script to startup.py in the \\~/.casa directory\n",
    "\n",
    "[[In addition, an ]{.s1}*\\\"execfile\\\"* [python shortcut has been added to the full installation of CASA 6 for backwards compatibility with ALMA scriptForPI.py restore scripts. This allows running scripts with the following command:]{.s1}]\n",

    "[[The]{.s1} *execfile*[ command in CASA 6 has been tested and found to work in the same way as in (Python 2 based) CASA 5 with the exception that the treatment of global variables has changed in Python 3. For ]{.s1}*execfile*[ calls within a script which itself is run via ]{.s1}*execfile*[, it is necessary to add *globals()* as the second argument to those ]{.s1}*execfile*[ calls in order for the nested script to know about the global variables of the calling script. For example, within a script *\\'mainscript.py\\'*, calls to another script *\\'myscript.py\\'* should be written as follows: ]{.s1}*execfile(\\'myscript.py\\', globals())*[ . ]{.s1}]\n",
