    "The CASA development group uses Bitbucket for revision control. Under the hood, Bitbucket employs git but is also integrated with JIRA, Bamboo (for continuous integration), and Confluence (wiki-like documentation).  This article explains the basics of revision control using BitBucket and git. For information on advanced BitBucket options, look for the question mark icon from any screen in the BitBucket web interface. Advanced information on git is widely available on the Web. The description below is for following the default workflow with the simplest command use.\n",

    "\n",
    "To do CASA development, you will need to get a copy of the CASA repository on your local machine. In the git revision control model, you will make a \\'clone\\' of the repository on the BitBucket server. The clone is effectively a local \\'working copy\\' of the code with its own git repository and a remote connection called \\'origin\\' pointing back to the original Bitbucket repository. You can edit files and commit changes in your cloned copy, then periodically push committed changes back to origin as well as pull changes from origin to the local repository.\n",

    "    **IMPORTANT**: The default name includes the ticket\\'s title but use the ticket number only**;** delete everything after the ticket number so that the CASA build and test process works properly. You can also create branches that do not start with \\\"CAS-\\\" prefix. Those branches will not trigger the standard build tests. An exception to this is the pull request build and test which will run regardless of the branch name. If you have an urgent and sufficiently independent change (f.e. unit test bug that only showed in master) you can create a branch with \\\"hotfix/\\\" prefix.

    "To retrieve your changes, use *git stash pop \\<stash\\>** ***(apply the changes and remove the stash from the stack) or *git stash apply \\<stash\\>* (apply the changes and leave the stash on the stack). If the stash argument is not used, git pops/applies the top of the stack.  Notice that there is one stash stack for all of the branches in the repository and you apply the changes to the current active branch. Therefore you can pop the stash to the same or a different branch than it came from; this may or may not be what you intended so be careful.
