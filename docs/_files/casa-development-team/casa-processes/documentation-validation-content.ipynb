Please locate and review the current (4.7.0) inline help and any current online help page ([CASA Task Reference Manual](https://casa.nrao.edu/docs/TaskRef/TaskRef.html), [CASA Toolkit Reference Manual](https://casa.nrao.edu/docs/CasaRef/CasaRef.html)) for tasks and tools, and the relevant section of the [CASA Cookbook ](https://casa.nrao.edu/casa_cookbook.pdf) for chapters, for context for the assigned documentation review.\n",

If you are reviewing a Chapter, please make sure that links to subpages on the \\\"front\\\" page (where all of the subpages are listed) each contain a one-line description of that subpage\\'s content. Links to the tasks and tools do not need this. For example, see the [Single Dish Calibration chapter front page](https://casa.nrao.edu/casadocs-devel/stable/calibration-and-visibility-data/single-dish-calibration). If the descriptions are missing, please add one.  \n",

Please refer back to CASA 4.7 to see the pre-plone-migration versions of the inline help files. Between the \\\"Description\\\" and \\\"Parameters\\\" tabs, are there adequate explanations for every parameter in the task?\n",
    "2.  Has old, non-relevant text that refers to earlier CASA versions been removed?\n",
    "3.  We need to compile references to specific tasks and tools in each Documentation Chapter, which should appear as links within the Chapter. These should already be set up, but if there are additional links that are necessary, please create them within the Chapter folder following the existing examples. \n",

    "3.  If you are reading a task/tool page, are the examples relevant? Should there be more (or fewer) examples? Please make suggestions if you think something is missing.\n",
    "4.  If you are reading a chapter, is the balance correct between the information found in the chapter text and that found linked in the relevant tasks and tools? Please make suggestions if you think something is missing."
