    "3.  T0: Developers begin work on housekeeping tasks.  Weekly CDG meetings should prioritize discussion of housekeeping issues.\n",
    "4.  T0 + 1 month: Housekeeping period ends.  The subsequent CDG weekly meeting should perform a short retrospective to gather developer feedback on the housekeeping process.  Additional housekeeping tasks identified during the process should be documented using new JIRA issues.  PM assesses accomplishments during housekeeping period and complies feedback.\n",
    "5.  T0 + 2 months: PM generates report on housekeeping activity that documents accomplishments, challenges, lessons learned, and any proposed process changes."
