Also, the current status of the latest c++ unit test runs can be seen here: <http://www.aoc.nrao.edu/~jjacobs/casaCodeTestDefinitionsStatus.html>. This table can be broken down by: first column (Tests) is number of unit tests known to the build system, the second (Legacy) is the number using the legacy (old, unused) tests, third column (Current) are those units tests using the new macros (and are live), and the final column is the ((number of current tests)/(total number of tests))\\*100. Or, the third column, divided by the first column times 100. Ideally we want the last column to be unity. \n",
