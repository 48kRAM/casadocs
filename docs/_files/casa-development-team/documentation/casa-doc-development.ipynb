    "        background behind CASA algorithms, as well as documentation on\n",
    "        tasks and tools,\n",

    "        well as developers outside the CASA team, and\n",

    "-   Inline Help: Available using the help() command at the CASA prompt,\n",
    "    the inline help documents tasks and tools and is derived from XML\n",
    "    stored in the CASA code repository. (Note that the parameter\n",
