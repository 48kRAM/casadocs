    "\n",
    "1.  Navigate to the Global Task List (Global Tool List) directory within CASA Documentation.\n",
    "2.  Login with your NRAO credentials.\n",
    "3.  You will find both published and private Tasks (Tools) within the directory as a logged in user.\n",
    "4.  Click 'Contents' on the Plone Toolbar.  You will be redirected to the Global Task List Contents page within Plone. The Contents page will list all published, private, and items excluded from navigation within the Global Task List. You should see a folder labelled 'TASK TEMPLATE' near the top of the list on the first page.  TASK TEMPLATE is an unpublished folder that contains all of the pages and code currently required for documenting a Task in CASA Docs.\n",
    "5.  Copy the TASK TEMPLATE folder and paste it back into Contents. You should now have a copy of TASK TEMPLATE at the bottom of the folder contents list.\n",
    "6.  Rename TASK TEMPLATE to the name of the Task you are documenting. Follow the naming conventions listed below:\n",
    "7.  Click on the new copy of TASK TEMPLATE.  You will enter the new TASK TEMPLATE folder.\n",
    "8.  Click Edit in the Plone Toolbar.\n",
    "9.  Update the Title field.  The title should be the name of the task \\-- one word and lowercase. Example: applycal\\'s title is \\\"applycal\\\".\n",
    "10. Update the Summary field with a one-line description of the task.  The description should be equivalent to the short description used in the *task.*xml file.  Example: imcollapse task: Collapse image along one axis, aggregating pixel values along that axis.\n",
    "11. Click on the Settings tab and update the Short Name field.  The Short Name should be \\\"task\\_\\\" + title of the task (\\\"tool\\_\\\" + title of the tool).  Example: applycal\\'s short name is \\\"task_applycal\\\"\n",
    "12. Click save.\n",
    "13. You are now ready to edit the pages within your new Task folder. Your new Task documentation folder should have six items total: Redirect, Description, Parameters, Changelog, Examples, and Developer.\n",
    "14. **DO NOT EDIT** the \\'Redirect\\', \\'Parameters\\', or \\'Changelog\\' pages in the Task. The \\'Redirect\\' page is a redirect link to the Task\\'s Description page for anonymous users. The 'Parameters' tab is automatically generated from the task XML file.   The 'Changelog' tab will eventually be automatically generated Bamboo pull-request strings.\n",
