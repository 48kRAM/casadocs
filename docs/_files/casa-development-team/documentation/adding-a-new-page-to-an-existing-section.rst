      To add a new page to the CASA Docs, follow this procedure:

      #. Navigate to the appropriate folder either using the directory
         (immediately to the left) or by clicking "Contents" in the
         left-side Plone toolbar and proceeding the proper folder.  (You
         must be in a folder to add a new page.)
      #. Click "Add new" in the left sidebar, then click "Page".  This
         will display the page editor.
      #. Insert the page title.
      #. Insert a 1-line summary of the page in the summary section.
      #. If the page is intended for CASA Developers select "yes" under
         CASA Developer.
      #. If the page is intended to be a subpage of another page in this
         chapter click "yes" under CASA subtopic.  (Note that a subpage
         is indented in the left-side directory and in the folder view. 
         Aside from these differences, subpages and pages are exactly
         the same.) 
      #. Enter the contet of the page in the Text section.
      #. To save your changes, make a note of the work you have done in
         the "Change Note" section and click "Save" at the bottom of the
         page.
      #. By default, new pages are created below all other pages in the
         directory.  If you want to reorganize the folder content, click
         "Contents" in the left side Plone toolbar.  Drag and drop pages
         into the desired order.
