You can see this by opening the CASA Docs [home page](https://casa.nrao.edu/casadocs-devel/).  The latest version of the documentation is the \\\"Stable\\\" version. Other released versions of CASA, beginning with CASA 5.0 are also available here. At the time of a CASA release, a snapshot of the stable documentation will be taken and that documentation will be frozen on the Plone server.\n",

    "Within each release version, the CASA documentation is divided into *topics*, which may be selected from the *directory* at the left sidebar. Each topic may have one or more *pages*, and each page may have zero or more *subpages*.  The only difference between a page and subpage is the way the item is formatted in the left sidebar directory.  Subpages are indented, whereas pages are not.  This allows authors to break long sections into multiple pages and indicate to the reader that the content is all related.  Aside from directory indentation, pages and subpages are identical.\n",

    "After each citation, insert a \\\"Link to Citation\\\" template. Edit the template to the appropriate index number of the citation (remove the hashtag), as seen above. This will create an index that links to that number in the bibliography. After that, insert a \\\"Citation\\\" template. This template contains a Citation Number and Citation Text entry.  Match the Citation Number with the index number you listed in the \\\"Link to Citation\\\" template. In the Citation Text area, write the author(s) and year and create a hyperlink to ADS, arxiv, or elsewhere to the actual paper, if possible. (Look at this page in Edit mode if you need an explicit example). Using citation templates will automatically create a Bibiogrpy at the end the page, sorted by the citation id/number. \n",
