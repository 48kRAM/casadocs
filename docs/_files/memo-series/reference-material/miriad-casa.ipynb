    "The Table below provides a list of common Miriad tasks, and their equivalent CASA tool or tool function names. The two packages differ in both their architecture and calibration and imaging models, and there is often not a direct correspondence. However, this index does provide a scientific user of CASA who is familiar with MIRIAD, with a simple translation table to map their existing data reduction knowledge to the new package.\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, note that the procedure of imaging and cleaning of visibility data between CASA and MIRIAD differs slightly. In MIRIAD the tasks invert, clean and restor are used in order to attain \\\"CLEAN\\\" images, whereas in CASA the task **clean**/**tclean** achieves the same steps as a single task.\n",
