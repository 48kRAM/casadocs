      This script re-calculates the common beam by discarding certain
      channels where the point-spread-function (PSF) or 'beam' deviates
      substantially from those of the other channels.

      The XY-phase calibration obtained with CASA task gaical
      (gaintype='XYf+QU') avoids to output +/- 45 degree solutions. This
      is a subtle consequence of the algorithm used to solve for the
      cross-hand phase, and should be harmless for the calibration of
      ALMA full-polarization data.
