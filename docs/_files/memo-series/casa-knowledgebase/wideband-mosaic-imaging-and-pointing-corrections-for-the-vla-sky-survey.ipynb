    "The Very Large Array Sky Survey ([VLASS](https://science.nrao.edu/vlass)) critically depends on accurate wideband mosaicing algorithms for its single epoch imaging and ultimately cumulative imaging. To a large degree, VLASS requirements have driven CASA's development of the AW-projection and related algorithms for [widefield](https://casa.nrao.edu/casadocs-devel/stable/imaging/synthesis-imaging/wide-field-imaging-full-primary-beam) and [wideband](https://casa.nrao.edu/casadocs-devel/stable/imaging/synthesis-imaging/wide-band-imaging) imaging in CASA. This Knowledgebase article provides complementary reports on the testing of Wideband Mosaic Imaging and Pointing Corrections for VLASS.\n",
