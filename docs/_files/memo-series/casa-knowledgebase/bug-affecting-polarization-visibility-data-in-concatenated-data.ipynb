    "1). *In general,* visibility data cross-hands may be spuriously swapped\n",
    "on some baselines in concat'd data when the antenna lists in the input\n",
    "MSs are *partially* different.&nbsp; The concat task adopts the first\n",
    "(in time order) MS's antenna list for the output MS, and appends unique\n",
    "antennas from later MS(s), typically with larger indices than in their\n",
    "original MSs.&nbsp; Depending on the original antenna indexing,\n",
    "baselines between these additional antennas and antennas that did occur\n",
    "in the first MS may sometimes require conjugation (reversal of the order\n",
    "of antennas in the baseline) to maintain internal indexing consistency\n",
    "within the output MS (for all baselines in an MS, the first antenna must\n",
    "have an index which is lower than (or same as) the index of the second\n",
    "antenna).&nbsp;&nbsp; When baselines are conjugated in this way, the\n",
    "sign of the phase of each correlation and the UVWs must be reversed, and\n",
    "the cross-hands swapped (RL or XY will become LR or YX, respectively,\n",
    "and vice-versa).&nbsp; Prior to CASA 5.7/6.1, the sign reversals were\n",
    "correct, but the cross-hand swap was spuriously omitted.&nbsp; For\n",
    "successfully calibrated data (i.e., calibrated *prior* to running\n",
    "concat), this means that the sign of the imaginary part of the\n",
    "cross-hand visibilities will be incorrect, and thus the sign Stokes U\n",
    "(for circular feeds) or Stokes V (for linear feeds) will be incorrect on\n",
    "the affected baselines in concat'd data. Since the pathology affects\n",
    "only the cross-hands, polarimetry calibration of concat'd data may be\n",
    "adversely affected.&nbsp;\n",
    "\n",
    "For reconfigurable arrays, note that an antenna's particular position\n",
    "(pad) makes it unique, i.e., a specific physical antenna that has moved\n",
    "is a new unique antenna in this context.&nbsp; Concatenation of\n",
    "*entirely* disjoint antenna lists are unaffected, since all additional\n",
    "antennas in the concatenation will have uniformly incremented indices,\n",
    "and no baseline conjugation will be required. &nbsp; Certain unique\n",
    "cases of different antenna lists are immune to this problem, e.g., new\n",
    "unique antennas with already-higher indices than all other common\n",
    "antennas, etc.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "2). The concat task initially sorts the MSs into time order (only at\n",
    "whole-MS granularity), so the effect cannot be controlled merely by\n",
    "adjusting the order in which the input MSs are specified in the concat\n",
    "call (i.e., there is no easy user-directed fix).\n",

    "3). An implicit concat happens in importfitsidi (i.e., VLBI, typically)\n",
    "when specifying multiple FITS-IDI files. Here the antenna re-indexing\n",
    "occurs upon fill, and thus most-likely *before* calibration.&nbsp; Since\n",
    "ordinary gain calibration uses only the parallel-hands, it will not be\n",

    "polarimetry calibration will be affected to the extent that there are\n",

    "observations consisting of multiple FITS-IDI will have the same antenna\n",
