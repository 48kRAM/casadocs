    "A careful analysis has revealed the following effects in concat\\'d MSs\n",
    "in CASA versions prior to 5.7/6.1:\\\n",
    "\\\n",
    "1). *In general,* visibility data cross-hands may be spuriously swapped\n",
    "on some baselines in concat\\'d data when the antenna lists in the input\n",
    "MSs are *partially* different.  The concat task adopts the first (in\n",
    "time order) MS\\'s antenna list for the output MS, and appends unique\n",
    "antennas from later MS(s), typically with larger indices than in their\n",
    "original MSs.  Depending on the original antenna indexing, baselines\n",
    "between these additional antennas and antennas that did occur in the\n",
    "first MS may sometimes require conjugation (reversal of the order of\n",
    "antennas in the baseline) to maintain internal indexing consistency\n",
    "within the output MS (for all baselines in an MS, the first antenna must\n",
    "have an index which is lower than (or same as) the index of the second\n",
    "antenna).   When baselines are conjugated in this way, the sign of the\n",
    "phase of each correlation and the UVWs must be reversed, and the\n",
    "cross-hands swapped (RL or XY will become LR or YX, respectively, and\n",
    "vice-versa).  Prior to CASA 5.7/6.1, the sign reversals were correct,\n",
    "but the cross-hand swap was spuriously omitted.  For successfully\n",
    "calibrated data (i.e., calibrated *prior* to running concat), this means\n",
    "that the sign of the imaginary part of the cross-hand visibilities will\n",
    "be incorrect, and thus the sign Stokes U (for circular feeds) or Stokes\n",
    "V (for linear feeds) will be incorrect on the affected baselines in\n",
    "concat\\'d data. Since the pathology affects only the cross-hands,\n",
    "polarimetry calibration of concat\\'d data may be adversely affected. \n",
    "\n",
    "For reconfigurable arrays, note that an antenna\\'s particular position\n",
    "(pad) makes it unique, i.e., a specific physical antenna that has moved\n",
    "is a new unique antenna in this context.  Concatenation of *entirely*\n",
    "disjoint antenna lists are unaffected, since all additional antennas in\n",
    "the concatenation will have uniformly incremented indices, and no\n",
    "baseline conjugation will be required.   Certain unique cases of\n",
    "different antenna lists are immune to this problem, e.g., new unique\n",
    "antennas with already-higher indices than all other common antennas,\n",
    "etc.\\\n",
    "\\\n",
    "2). The concat task initially sorts the MSs into time order (only at\n",
    "whole-MS granularity), so the effect cannot be controlled merely by\n",
    "adjusting the order in which the input MSs are specified in the concat\n",
    "call (i.e., there is no easy user-directed fix).\n",
    "\n",
    "3). An implicit concat happens in importfitsidi (i.e., VLBI, typically)\n",
    "when specifying multiple FITS-IDI files. Here the antenna re-indexing\n",
    "occurs upon fill, and thus most-likely *before* calibration.  Since\n",
    "ordinary gain calibration uses only the parallel-hands, it will not be\n",
    "affected by the underlying cross-hand swap error.  However, polarimetry\n",
    "calibration will be affected to the extent that there are spuriously\n",
    "swapped cross-hands within the filled MS.  EVN observations consisting\n",
    "of multiple FITS-IDI will have the same antenna table in each file and\n",
    "are therefore unaffected by this bug.\\\n",
    "\\\n",
    "4). Since the pathology affects only the cross-hands, purely Stokes I\n",
    "(total intensity) observations of any kind should not be affected (even\n",
    "if the cross-hand are present and some are affected, and thus\n",
    "technically incorrect).\n",
    "\n",
    "5). For ALMA and VLA data, calibration typically occurs prior to any\n",
    "potentially pathological use of concat, and the impact will be as\n",
    "follows:\n",

    "5a). ALMA:  Total intensity observations of any kind are not affected. \n",
    "For successfully calibrated (per session) ALMA polarization data not\n",

    "execblocks within each session\\*, the pathology affects only Stokes V\n",
    "(circular polarization) when concat-ing multiple sessions subject to the\n",
    "baseline conjugation conditions described in item 1 above.  This is\n",
    "because the spurious cross-hand swap effectively sabotages only the sign\n",
    "of the imaginary part of the cross-hands in some baselines, i.e., the\n",
    "apparent Stokes V signal sampled by linear feeds.  The net effect will\n",
    "be to suppress the net Stokes V signal in imaging.   This presumably\n",
    "affects only a very tiny minority of existing ALMA observations.\n",

    "<div class=\"alert alert-info\">\n",
    "\\* **Note:** In the course of standard scripted ALMA polarimetry\n",

    "will be suppressed.  Since this affects part of the linearly polarized\n",
    "net response, a larger fraction of VLA cases (cf ALMA) may be affected. \n",
    "The pathological condition arises when antennas are variously removed\n",
    "from the array (typically up to 2 or 3 at any given time) for incidental\n",
    "maintenance, so as to generate datasets with fewer than the full\n",
