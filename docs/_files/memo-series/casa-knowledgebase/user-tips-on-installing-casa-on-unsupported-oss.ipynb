    "Fedora 32 may cause CASA to crash on startup with the error *\\\"code for hash md5 was not found\\\"*. This is caused by changes to libssl.so in the compat-openssl10 package, which prevents the CASA supplied version of this library from loading. An easy fix is to replace the CASA version of libssl.so.10 with the OS version in /lib64 (i.e., libssl.so.1.0.2o)."
