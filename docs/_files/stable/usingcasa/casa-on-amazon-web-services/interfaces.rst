      The `AWS console <https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/getting-started/>`__
      is a web interface used to control AWS resources. For users
      launching isolated instances and querying status, this is likely
      the simplest and most commonly used interface.

      `The
      CLI <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-set-up.html>`__
      is the command line interface to AWS. This software, installed on
      your local computer, can be used to launch and control AWS
      resources. This interface is most useful for repeated tasks and
      simple automation

      The python SDK interface is beyond the scope of this document, but
      more information can be found
      `here <https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-python/>`__. The python
      interface is most useful for complex automation frameworks and
      includes a REST-ful interface to all AWS resources.
