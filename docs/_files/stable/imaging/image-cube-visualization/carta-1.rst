      CARTA is the Cube Analysis and Rendering Tool for Astronomy, a new
      image visualization and analysis tool designed for the
      `ALMA <http://www.almaobservatory.org>`__, the
      `VLA <https://science.nrao.edu/facilities/vla>`__, and the `SKA
      pathfinders <https://skatelescope.org/>`__. CARTA is expected to
      replace the CASA Viewer in the foreseeable future.

      CARTA is an external data analysis package that is being developed
      by the `Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics
      (ASIAA) <https://www.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw>`__ the `Inter-University
      Institute for Data Intensive Astronomy
      (IDIA) <https://idia.ac.za>`__, the `National Radio Astronomy
      Observatory (NRAO) <https://science.nrao.edu>`__, and
      the `Department of Physics, University of
      Alberta <https://www.ualberta.ca/physics>`__

      As the image size increases drastically with modern telescopes in
      recent years, viewing an image with a local image viewer or with a
      remote image viewer via the ssh protocol becomes less efficient.
      The mission of CARTA is to provide usability and scalability for
      the future by utilizing modern web technologies and computing
      parallelization.

      CARTA currently already has various capabilities in common the
      CASA Viewer, but development is still ongoing and not yet all
      features of the CASA Viewer are available in CARTA. Nevertheless,
      development of CARTA is progressing rapidly, and since development
      of the CASA Viewer has put on hold in favor of this, we recommend
      users to try CARTA for those instances where the CASA Viewer is
      inadequate. These include:

      -  efficiently loading large data cubes
      -  flexibility in assigning regions for data analysis
      -  clean labeling of the axis

      We expect this list to grow rapidly with upcoming CARTA releases.
