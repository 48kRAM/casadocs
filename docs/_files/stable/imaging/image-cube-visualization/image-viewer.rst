      This documentation describes how to use the CASA Viewer to display
      data. The Viewer can be started as a stand-alone executable or by
      the viewertask inside a CASA shell. It can display both images and
      MeasurementSets. The task-level access to the Viewer has been
      split into two tasks: imviewfor images and msviewfor
      MeasurementSets. These tasks offer improved scriptability, giving
      command line access to many of the viewer features.

      For help on the image viewer, please see the subpages shown in the
      tabs to the left. For the Visibility visualization, please
      see\ `2-D Visualization and Flagging of Visibility
      Data <https://casa.nrao.edu/casadocs-devel/stable/calibration-and-visibility-data/data-examination-and-editing/2-d-visualization-of-visibility-data-msview>`__\ .Â
