      The Very Large Array Sky Survey
      (`VLASS <https://science.nrao.edu/vlass>`__) critically depends on
      accurate wideband mosaicing algorithms for its single epoch
      imaging and ultimately cumulative imaging. To a large degree,
      VLASS requirements have driven CASA’s development of the
      AW-projection and related algorithms for
      `widefield <https://casa.nrao.edu/casadocs-devel/stable/imaging/synthesis-imaging/wide-field-imaging-full-primary-beam>`__
      and
      `wideband <https://casa.nrao.edu/casadocs-devel/stable/imaging/synthesis-imaging/wide-band-imaging>`__
      imaging in CASA. This Knowledgebase article provides complementary
      reports on the testing of Wideband Mosaic Imaging and Pointing
      Corrections for VLASS.
