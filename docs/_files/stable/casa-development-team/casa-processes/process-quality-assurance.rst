      The goal of process quality assurance (QA) is to maintain the
      quality of CASA team processes by educating members of the CASA
      team on the details of team processes and ensuring compliance with
      the processes the team chooses for itself.  Process QA is itself a
      process that can be broken into four steps that will be performed
      in an iterative fashion:

      #. Define/update processes,
      #. Ensure compliance with processes,
      #. Gather feedback from team, and
      #. Improve processes.

      .. rubric:: Process Definition
         :name: process-definition

      The CASA project manager (PM) is primarily responsible for
      documenting processes approved by the group lead (GL).  CASA
      Process documentation will be stored in the `CASA
      Processes <https://casa.nrao.edu/casadocs-devel/stable/casa-development-team/casa-processes>`__
      chapter of the CASA Doc website.

      The PM and GL will assess the need for team process education
      after each process update.

      .. rubric:: Ensure Process Compliance
         :name: ensure-process-compliance

      The PM is also responsible for auditing the CASA team work to
      document conformance and non-conformance to selected processes. 
      Beginning in FY17 Q2, select metrics (TBD) will be reported by the
      PM to select recipients (TBD).

      .. rubric:: Team Feedback
         :name: team-feedback

      An annual CASA team retrospective will be performed in Q3 of each
      year.  The retrospective will provide a forum for discussion of
      what is and is not working well within the team.  The PM will
      organize and facilitate the retrospective and generate a report
      that summarizes the discussion and decisions.  The report will be
      circulated within the team for additional input.

      Informal feedback on processes can be given to the CASA PM and
      CASA GL at any time. 

      .. rubric:: Process Improvement
         :name: process-improvement

      The retrospective report will be used by the PM and GL to create a
      process improvement plan that will be written by the PM and
      approved by the GL in Q4 of each year.
