      The CASA road map describes the high-level plan for CASA
      development over the next 4 to 6 quarters. The road map is written
      for internal audiences. The road map may be a subset of the group
      management document described in `DMSD Software Development
      Processes <https://sharepoint.nrao.edu/pmd/projects/494%20CASA%20Recommendations%20for%20Improvement%20%20Implemen/DMSD%20SW%20Dev%20Processes.aspx>`__.
      A table such as the one shown in figure 9 of `Recommendations for
      Improvement <https://sharepoint.nrao.edu/pmd/projects/494%20CASA%20Recommendations%20for%20Improvement%20%20Implemen/DMSD%20SW%20Dev%20Processes.aspx>`__
      may be used to communicate the quarterly focus of the CASA team.

      To remain relevant and informative, the road map will be updated
      twice annually, in quarters 2 and 4. The updated roadmap should be
      made available at or before the time of the official software
      release.
