      .. rubric:: **Before You Start
         **
         :name: before-you-start

      #. Make sure you log into plone so that any pages currently marked
         "private" are visible to you. 
      #. Verifiers should review the `CASA Docs style
         guide <https://casa.nrao.edu/casadocs-devel/stable/casa-development-team/documentation/style-guide>`__
         before beginning verification.
      #. Take a quick tour of plone by clicking the wrench in the upper
         right corner --> "Tutorials" --> "Introduction". It will show
         you several messages pointing out the different features of
         plone. You may need to toggle the "developer mode" on to see
         more content; best to turn this on, just in case.

      .. rubric:: Editorial Content and Style
         :name: editorial-content-and-style

      Note: Validators should plan to make minor document changes
      directly to the document. Extensive changes should be reported
      back to the author using the appropriate JIRA ticket.

      .. rubric:: Page look and feel
         :name: page-look-and-feel

      #. Does the page conform to style guide rules?
      #. Does the organization of the page make sense?
      #. Are figures formatted appropriately?
      #. Are text boxes used in a way that enhances the readability of
         the document?
      #. Are there obvious changes that would improve the overall look
         and feel of the document?
      #. For tasks and tools, please ensure that the information is
         divided appropriately between the "Description" and "Examples"
         tabs, such that "Examples" contains only explicit examples, and
         all other information falls under "Description". 

      .. rubric:: Workflow
         :name: workflow

      #. Load the `Google
         spreadsheet <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YjPYn5K6Y2RCmHKkW9_ddVBrKphpX4wEqbpaG5eEudE/edit#gid=0>`__.
      #. Anything with a "1" in the "Ready for Style Check" column is
         ready for style verification.
      #. Assign yourself the relevant JIRA ticket (which should be in
         the state "Ready for Verification") and move it to "Under
         Verification." 
      #. Check through the relevant pages of plone documentation and
         make your changes.
      #. Once you're satisfied, move the status of the JIRA ticket to
         "Ready for Validation" and assign it to Jen Donovan Meyer so
         that she can assign the content check. 
      #. Put a "1" in the "Ready for Content Check" column in the Google
         spreadsheet. 
      #. You're done!
