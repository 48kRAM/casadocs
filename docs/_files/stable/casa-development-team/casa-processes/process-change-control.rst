      This process defines the steps involved in changing CASA process
      definitions.  To maintain effective and meaningful processes, it
      is important to consult with relevant stakeholders inside and
      outside the team before a change is made.  After making a change,
      all impacted stakeholders must be notified.  

      Changes to CASA process documents will follow these steps.

      #. Changes will be proposed to the group lead (GL). 
      #. The GL will discuss the changes with the project manager (PM)
         and other stakeholders as appropriate.
      #. The GL will approve or reject the proposed change.
      #. If approved, the GL or his delegate will update the CASA
         process documents.
      #. An annoucement of the change will be made to the casa-staff
         mailing list and the lead of the NRAO DMS software division.
