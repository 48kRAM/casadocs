      Displays images, data cubes and MeasurementSets.

      The **viewer** will display images in raster, contour, vector or
      marker form. Images can be blinked, and movies are available for
      spectral-line image cubes. For MeasurementSets, many display and
      editing options are available.

      The **viewer** can be run by typing viewer within CASA, or
      casaviewer outside of CASA. Executing **viewer** will bring up a
      display panel window, which can be resized. If no data file was
      specified, a Load Data window will also appear. Click on the
      desired data file and choose the display type; the rendered data
      should appear on the display panel. A Data Display Options window
      will also appear. It has drop-down subsections for related
      options, most of which are self-explanatory.

      The loaded data and related display options can be saved in a
      'restore' file for later use. You can provide the restore filename
      on the command line or select it from the Load Data window.

      **viewer** to display images and MSes.
