    "and total power arrays. It takes an input model image or a list of\n",
    "components, plus configurations of ALMA antennas (locations and sizes),\n",
    "and simulates a particular ALMA observation (specified by mosaic setup\n",
    "and observing cycles and times). The outputs are MeasurementSets. The\n",
