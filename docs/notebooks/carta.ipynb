        "CARTA is the *Cube Analysis and Rendering Tool for Astronomy*, a new image visualization and analysis tool designed for the [ALMA](https://www.almaobservatory.org/en/home/), the [VLA](https://science.nrao.edu/facilities/vla), and the [SKA pathfinders](https://www.skatelescope.org/). As the image size increases drastically with modern telescopes in recent years, viewing an image with a local image viewer or with a remote image viewer via the ssh protocol becomes less efficient. The mission of CARTA is to provide usability and scalability for the future by utilizing modern web technologies and computing parallelization.\n",

Many things are complete, and CARTA offers a good deal of enhanced functionality over the Viewer, but a small subset of things may still be missing. The old CASA Viewer documentation sections are included here as well for reference in situations where CARTA is not yet sufficient.\n",

        "-   Proper display of image headers\n",
