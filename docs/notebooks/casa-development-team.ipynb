The Data Management and Software Department (DMSD) has developed a [software development processes document](https://staff.nrao.edu/wiki/bin/view/DMS/DMSDevelopmentProcesses) that describes departmental policies and recommendations for its software teams; this document adopts some of the recommendations applicable across the department.

    "The work scheduling processes consists of two basic steps: duration estimation and activity scheduling.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Duration Estimates\n",
    "\n",
    "Developers should estimate the development duration of Bugs, Features, Engineering Tasks, Research Requests, and Sub-tasks.  These 5 issue types should have durations of 2 weeks or less.  Any issue requiring more than 2 weeks of effort should be converted to an Epic and assigned to the PM for estimation and scheduling.  To simplify the estimation and scheduling process, developers are encouraged to reserve one day per week for miscellaneous tasks (team meetings, helping a colleague, etc.).  Thus, an issue scheduled to last 2 weeks would take 8 ideal working days of effort.  The reserved 1 day per week also provides a buffer for the scheduled tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Activity Scheduling\n",
    "\n",
    "The CDG will use as soon as possible (ASAP) scheduling to favor predictability of development effort.  This means that new issues are scheduled for work after all previously scheduled tasks.  This will allow better coordination with scientists by providing advanced notification of when the development work will be completed.  Expediting of tasks (scheduling a new issue before a previously scheduled task) is allowed only by approval of the GL.  Developers are responsible for scheduling Bug, Feature, Engineering Task, and Research Requests.  The PM is responsible for scheduling Epics.\n",
    "\n",
    "The CDG currently has a large backlog of work recorded in JIRA tasks.  True ASAP scheduling would require that the backlog be fully scheduled.  To avoid unnecessary effort, a gradual approach will be applied instead, where the backlog is scheduled 2 months in advance until the team retrospective in Q3 FY17.  During this time, the team will work toward improved estimation accuracy.  A plan for moving toward true ASAP scheduling will be included in the process improvement plan delivered in Q4.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each developer should have one issue scheduled at any given time.  In other words, developers should prioritize the currently scheduled issue above all not-currently-scheduled issues.  Only blocker-priority issues will preempt a scheduled task.  When a developer\\'s work on an issue is waiting on another resource (e.g. waiting on a response from a scientist, or waiting for a build and test cycle to complete) it is acceptable to work on another issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-info\">\n",

In the git revision control model, you will make a \\'clone\\' of the repository on the BitBucket server. The clone is effectively a local \\'working copy\\' of the code with its own git repository and a remote connection called \\'origin\\' pointing back to the original Bitbucket repository. You can edit files and commit changes in your cloned copy, then periodically push committed changes back to origin as well as pull changes from origin to the local repository.\n",

An exception to this is the pull request build and test which will run regardless of the branch name. If you have an urgent and sufficiently independent change (f.e. unit test bug that only showed in master) you can create a branch with \\\"hotfix/\\\" prefix.

For example, if you have three modified files in your repository that implement a bug fix and a new feature, you can commit two files for the bug fix separately from the third file for the feature. Therefore, the commit is actually a *changeset*, all of the files that implement a specific change.

    "##### Using the CASA Data Repository\n",
    "\n",
    "The CASA team switched to using [Git LFS](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/git-lfs) for maintaining the CASA Data Repository when source code version control switched from Subversion to Git. Git LFS permits managing large binary files by storing the actual files outside of Git, but checking checksum based stubs into Git as a proxy for the actual files. This system does work, but it is **prone to accidental checkin of the actual binary data**. For this reason, it is **crucial that extra care be exercised when committing to the CASA Data Repository**. This is because the only way to correct the error of pushing binary files committed directly to Git instead of through LFS to the Atlassian bitbucket server is by recreating the entire Data Repository from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Please follow the steps in \\\"Check Before Committing\\\" below before making commits in your local Data Repository clone.**\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Git Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "While no specific changes are required to your Git setup, there are some changes which make the checkout of the data repository much more convenient because without these changes the default credential caching timeout will cause Git LFS to prompt (often) as files are downloaded.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### OSX\n",
    "\n",
    "For OSX, setting the OSX keychain as the credential source allows the LFS checkout to proceed without prompting for passwords. This can be done with:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` {.p1}\n",
    "-bash-4.1$ git config --global credential.helper osxkeychain\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Linux\n",
    "\n",
    "For Linux, there is no facility for general password management so the easiest solution for Linux is to increase the credential timeout:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` {.p1}\n",
    "-bash-4.1$ git config --global credential.helper cache\n",
    "-bash-4.1$ git config --global credential.helper 'cache --timeout=3600'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Git LFS Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "Git LFS is distributed as an add-on to Git, so before you begin to use Git Lfs, ensure that it is actually installed. If you run (and see) the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` {.p1}\n",
    "-bash-4.1$ git lfs help\n",
    "No manual entry for gitlfs\n",
    "-bash-4.1$\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It means that Git LFS is not installed on your system, contact your local system administrator. Most CASA Linux developers should get Git LFS as part of the installation of \\'casa-toolset-2\\' which includes Git LFS.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Setup Your Git LFS Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "LFS is switched on or off by Git users not by something committed to the repository. For this reason, you should add LFS to your Git environment on any logins that you will use to commit changes to the CASA Data Repository. [It is best to set LFS as a global option](https://shuhrat.github.io/programming/git-lfs-tips-and-tricks.html) so tha you do not need to initialize LFS each time you clone the data repository. You can do this by running the following commands at the bash command line:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` {.p1}\n",
    "git config --global filter.lfs.required true\n",
    "git config --global filter.lfs.clean \"git-lfs clean -- %f\"\n",
    "git config --global filter.lfs.smudge \"git-lfs smudge -- %f\"\n",
    "git config --global filter.lfs.process \"git-lfs filter-process\"\n",

    "It is also possible to set up Git LFS on a per-repository basis.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Checking Out the Data Repository {#checking-out-the-data-repository .p1}\n",
    "\n",
    "The Data Repository is very large. The actual data content is 73GB, but a regular checkout (in Subversion or Git) requires a disk footprint of 153GB. Therefore the best way to start using the CASA Data Repository is to begin with a limited clone:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` {.p1}\n",

    "\n",
    "1.   checkout the minimal data repository that is distributed with each binary distribution of CASA\n",
    "2.  checkout the entire data repository\n",
    "\n",
    "These are described in the next two subsections. An alternative to this more typical clone of the Data Repository is to clone only the LFS stubs for a look under the hood of LFS. This is described in the third subsection.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Distro Data Repository\n",
    "\n",
    "The distro data repository is the minimal subset of the CASA Data Repository which is required for CASA to function properly at runtime. It can be retrieved (after doing the \\\"no checkout\\\" clone command above) like:\n",

Contributions to the documentation should always be made on the development server.  A static copy of this documentation is maintained for each release on the production server.  Please respect the [style guide](https://casa.nrao.edu/casadocs-devel/stable/casa-development-team/documentation/style-guide) when adding to the CASA Docs.  The CASA Docs include the following types of content:    -   End-user information on how to use CASA, the theoretical background behind CASA algorithms, as well as documentation on tasks and tools,\n",
    "    -   Developer-oriented information on various aspects of the CASA system; this information is intended for CASA team developers as well as developers outside the CASA team, and\n",
    "    -   Information on processes followed by the CASA Development team.\n",
    "-   Inline Help: Available using the help() command at the CASA prompt, the inline help documents tasks and tools and is derived from XML stored in the CASA code repository. (Note that the parameter description in the inline help is parsed to the \\\"Parameter\\\" pages of the Global Task List in CASA Docs)\n",

The Twiki predates Confluence and also includes historical project documentation.  The [CASAIndex](https://safe.nrao.edu/wiki/bin/view/Software/CasaIndex) is an even older wiki, but may still contain useful information.\n",
    "-   [Confluence](https://open-confluence.nrao.edu/display/CASA/CASA+Home): This site is used to record CASA team planning information regarding releases and team projects.  The site also includes a team calendar that is integrated with JIRA.\n",

    "\n",
    "The [CASA Docs](https://casa.nrao.edu/casadocs/) are stored on the NRAO CASA Docs server, and can be accessed in CASA with the doc() command.  The CASA Docs were first released with CASA 5.0 as a replacement for the [CASA Cookbook](http://casa.nrao.edu/docs/cookbook/index.html), [Task Reference](http://casa.nrao.edu/docs/TaskRef/TaskRef.html), [Toolkit Manual](http://casa.nrao.edu/docs/CasaRef/CasaRef.html), and other miscellaneous CASA documentation.  The CASA Docs were incomplete at the time of the 5.0 release, including only a subset of CASA tasks and tools. As per CASA 5.3, all tasks have been included in CASA Docs. The tools will be added in future releases.\n",
    "\n",
    "CASA Docs Plone accounts are created either automatically based on the NRAO Windows Active Directory (AD) system, or by a Plone administrator manually creating a new account.  All NRAO staff have a Windows AD account and therefore have an account on the CASA Doc Plone system.  In addition to having an account, all CASA Docs contributors must be added to the \\\"Content Creators\\\" group in Plone.\n",
    "\n",
    "The CASA Docs Plone server has been set up to allow for 3 page states: Private, Internal, and Public.  The state of any page can be changed in the left-side Plone tool bar, visible after logging into the CASA Doc Plone system.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   The **Private** state is the default state for a new page.  Pages in the private state are only visible by members of the Content Creators group.  New CASA Docs content should remain in the Private state until it is validated by the CASA validation team.\n",
    "-   **Internal** pages are visible by any person logged into the Plone system, whether or not they are in the Content Creators group.  The Internal state was created for CASA documentation that should be visible to observatory staff but should not be visible to the world.  This includes some information about the CASA build and test system.\n",
    "-   **Public** pages are visible to the world.  Pages are made public after being validated.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the page state, all pages contain two additional flags: the developer flag, and the subtopic flag.  Both flags can be set when editing a page.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   The **developer flag** marks the page as being visible only in developer mode.  Developer mode can be toggled on and off using the right-side tool bar.  Look for the icon with the \\<\\> brackets.  By default developer mode is off and all developer pages are hidden from the Plone navigation.  When turned on, the developer pages become visible in the Plone navigation, and are appended by \\\"(developer)\\\".\n",
    "-   The **subtopic flag** marks a page as containing a subsection of the previous page.  This allows for an additional level of hierarchical organization without using an additional Plone folder.  Subtopic pages, like all pages, must be organized manually using the \\\"Contents\\\" view, available from the left-side Plone toolbar.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### CASA Docs Contribution Process\n",
    "\n",
    "Contributions to the CASA Docs should follow the process described here.  All CASA Docs changes should be recorded in a JIRA ticket (unless the change is very minor; e.g. grammatical corrections); the JIRA ticket will follow the same basic process used for software development work. \n",
    "\n",
    "The author should be familiar with the CASA Docs Style Guide before adding content.  After adding all the new content to Plone, the JIRA ticket should be moved to the Ready to Verify state and assigned to the CASA Scientific Testing Lead (currently Jen Donovan Meyer).  Jen will assign the ticket to a style reviewer who will verify that the new content conforms to the Style Guide.  The style reviewer may make changes to the page to bring it into conformance with the style guide.  After passing style review, the JIRA ticket will be moved to the Ready to Validate state and Jen will assign the ticket to a content reviewer.  (Currently, we are only performing content reviews for pages that are not in developer mode.)  The content reviewer may make small changes directly to the document.  Requests for extensive changes will be returned to the author, at which point the JIRA ticket will go through the Verification and Validation process again.  After passing validation, Jen will mark the associated Plone page(s) as public and resolve the JIRA ticket.  The documentation changes will then become public during the next weekly update of the prerelease documentation on the CASA Docs production server.\n",

The Plone system has been designed to automatically link bold task/tool names to the corresponding task/tool folder.  To enable this autolinking for a new task or tool, notify the CASA Docs web developer.  This notification is currently being done via JIRA ticket [CAS-9596](https://open-jira.nrao.edu/browse/CAS-9596). \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Development and Production\n",
    "\n",
    "The CASA Docs development server is here: <https://casa.nrao.edu/casadocs-devel/>.  This is where contributors should add and edit CASA Docs content.  The version of the CASA documentation on the development server should very closely follow the BitBucket master branch.  Some discrepancies may exist when developers are waiting for a pull request to be serviced.  However, developers should aim to add content to the CASA Docs development version only when they believe the corresponding code will be pulled into the master branch imminently.  Special care should be taken around the time of feature and code freezes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The CASA Docs production server is here: <https://casa.nrao.edu/casadocs/>.  The production server hosts CASA Documentation for each major release and patch beginning with CASA 5.0.  The CASA Docs production server also contains documentation for the latest CASA prerelease, which is updated on a weekly basis from the development server.  All documentation on the production server can be updated by Plone administrators, and, when necessary, by other Plone account holders. \n",
    "\n",
    "When a new release branch is created in BitBucket, a permanent snapshot of the development documentation is made on the production server.  After creating the snapshot, the development documentation continues to follow the BitBucket master branch toward the subsequent CASA release.  In the case of a CASA patch, the CASA Docs web developer will copy the appropriate documentation tree to create a new documentation tree for the patch.  For example, if a 5.0.1 patch is planned for release, the 5.0.0 tree should be copied and renamed 5.0.1.  A plone administrator should then update the new tree based on the content of the patch.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "When a new CASA build is created, the appropriate CASA Docs tree is copied off of the production server using a wget script.  Only public pages are included in the packaged documentation.  The packaged documentation can be accessed using the doc() command from the CASA command line.  The doc() command accepts string arguments that open the documentation to specific CASA Doc pages.

Each topic may have one or more *pages*, and each page may have zero or more *subpages*.
