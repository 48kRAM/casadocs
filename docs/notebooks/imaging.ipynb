    "\n",
    "Image reconstruction in radio interferometry is the process of solving the linear system of equations $\\vec{V} = [A] \\vec{I}$, where $\\vec{V}$ represents visibilities calibrated for direction independent effects, $\\vec{I}$ is a list of parameters that model the sky brightness distribution (for example, a image of pixels) and $[A]$ is the measurement operator that encodes the process of how visibilities are generated when a telescope observes a sky brightness $\\vec{I}$.  $[A]$ is generally given by $[S_{dd}][F]$ where $[F]$ represents a 2D Fourier transform, and $[S_{dd}]$ represents a 2D spatial frequency sampling function that can include direction-dependent instrumental effects. For a practical interferometer with a finite number of array elements, $[A]$ is non-invertible because of unsampled regions of the $uv$ plane. Therefore, this system of equations must be solved iteratively, applying constraints via various choices of image parameterizations and instrumental models.\n",

    "##### Implementation ( major and minor cycles ):\n",
    "\n",
    "Image reconstruction in CASA comprises an outer loop of *major cycles* and an inner loop of *minor cycles*. The major cycle implements transforms between the data and image spaces and the minor cycle operates purely in the image domain. Together, they implement an iterative weighted $\\chi^2$ minimization process that solves the measurement equation.\n",

    "\n",
    "The data to image transform is called the *imaging* step in which a pseudo inverse of $[S_{dd}][F]$ is computed and applied to the visibilities. Operationally, weighted visibilities are convolutionally resampled onto a grid of spatial-frequency cells, inverse Fourier transformed, and normalized. This step is equivalent to calculating the normal equations as part of a least squares solution. The image to data transform is called the *prediction* step and it evaluates the measurement equation to convert a model of the sky brightness into a list of model visibilities that are later subtracted from the data to form residual visibilities. For both transforms, direction dependent instrumental effects can be accounted for via carefully constructed convolution functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Iterations begin with an initial guess for the image model.  Each major cycle consists of the prediction of model visibilities, the calculation of residual visibilities and the construction of a residual image. This residual image contains the effect of incomplete sampling of the spatial-frequency plane but is otherwise normalized to the correct sky flux units. In its simplest form, it can be written as a convolution of the true sky image with a point spread function. The job of the minor cycle is to iteratively build up a model of the true sky by separating it from the point spread function. This step is also called *deconvolution* and is equivalent to the process of solving the normal equations as part of a least squares solution. Different reconstruction algorithms can operate as minor cycle iterations, allowing for flexibility in (for example) how the sky brightness is parameterized. The imaging step can be approximate in that several direction dependent effects, especially baseline, frequency or time-dependent ones can sometimes  ignored, minor cycles can be approximate in that they use only PSF patches and do not try to be accurate over the entire image, but the prediction step of the major cycle must be as accurate as possible such that model components are converted to visibilities by including all possible instrumental effects.\n",

    "\n",
    "Within the CASA implementation, numerous choices are provided to enable the user to fine-tune the details of their image reconstruction. Images can be constructed as spectral cubes with multiple frequency channels or single-plane wideband continuum images. One or more sub images may be defined to cover a wide field of view without incurring the computational expense of very large images. The iterative framework described above is based on the Cotton-Schwab Clean algorithm [\\[3\\]](#Bibliography), but variants like Hogbom Clean [\\[1\\]](#Bibliography) and Clark Clean [\\[2\\]](#Bibliography) are available as subsets of this framework. The major cycle allows controls over different data weighting schemes [\\[10\\]](#Bibliography) and convolution functions that account for wide-field direction-dependent effects during imaging and prediction \\[[\\[6\\]](#Bibliography), [\\[7\\]](#Bibliography) , [\\[8\\]](#Bibliography)\\]. Deconvolution options include the use of point source vs multi-scale image models [\\[4\\]](#Bibliography) , narrow-band or wide-band models [\\[5\\]](#Bibliography), controls on iteration step size and stopping criteria, and external constraints such as interactive and non-interactive image masks. Mosaics may be made with data from multiple pointings, either with each pointing imaged and deconvolved separately before being combined in a final step, or via a joint imaging and deconvolution [\\[9\\]](#Bibliography). Options to combine single dish and interferometer data during imaging also exist. More details about these algorithms can be obtained from \\[[\\[10\\]](#Bibliography), [\\[11\\]](#Bibliography), [\\[12\\]](#Bibliography), [\\[13\\]](#Bibliography)\\] \n",

    "During imaging, the visibilities can be weighted in different ways to alter the instrument\\'s natural response function in ways that make the image-reconstruction tractable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data weighting during imaging allows for the improvement of the dynamic range and the ability to adjust the synthesized beam associated with the produced image. The weight given to each visibility sample can be adjusted to fit the desired output. There are several reasons to adjust the weighting, including improving sensitivity to extended sources or accounting for noise variation between samples. The user can adjust the weighting using **clean** and changing the *weighting* parameter with six options: \\'natural\\', \\'uniform\\', \\'briggs\\',  \\'superuniform\\', \\'briggsabs\\', and \\'radial\\'. Optionally, a UV taper can be applied, and various parameters can be set to further adjust the weight calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "###### Natural weighting\n",
    "\n",
    "*Summary:* The natural weighting scheme gives equal weight to all samples. Since usually, lower spatial frequencies are sampled more often than the higher ones, the inner uv-plane will have a significantly higher density of samples and hence signal-to-noise than the outer uv-plane. The resulting \\\"density-upweighting\\\" of the inner uv-plane will produce the largest angular resolution and can sometimes result in undesirable structure in the PSF which reduces the accuracy of the minor cycle. However, at the location of a source, this method preserves the natural point-source sensitivity of the instrument.\n",
    "\n",
    "For *weighting=\\'natural\\'*, visibilities are weighted only by the data weights, which are calculated during filling and calibration and should be equal to the inverse noise variance on that visibility. Imaging weight $w_i$ of sample $\\dot\\imath$ is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$w_i = \\omega_i = \\frac{1}{{\\sigma_i}^2}$\n",
    "\n",
    "where the data weight $\\omega_i$ is determined from $\\sigma_i$, the rms noise on visibility $\\dot\\imath$. When data is gridded into the same uv-cell for imaging, the weights are summed, and thus a higher uv density results in higher imaging weights. No sub-parameters are linked to this mode choice. It is the default imaging weight mode, and it should produce \"optimum\" image with with the lowest noise (highest signal-to-noise ratio).\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-info\">\n",
    "**NOTE**: This generally produces images with the poorest angular resolution, since the density of visibilities falls radially in the uv-plane.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Uniform weighting \n",
    "\n",
    "*Summary:* Uniform weighting gives equal weight to each measured spatial frequency irrespective of sample density. The resulting PSF has the narrowest possible main lobe (i.e. smallest possible angular resolution) and suppressed sidelobes across the entire image and is best suited for sources with high signal-to-noise ratios to minimize sidelobe contamination between sources. However, the peak sensitivity is significantly worse than optimal (typically \\~20% worse for reasonably large number of antenna interferometers), since data points in densely sampled regions have been weighted down to make the weights uniform. Also, isolated measurements can get artifically high relative weights and this may introduce further artifacts into the PSF.\n",

When using *Briggs* style weight with *perchanweightdensity=True*, the imaging weight density calculations use only the weights of data that contribute specifically to that channel. On the other hand, when *perchanweightdensity=False*, the imaging weight density calculations sum all of the weights from all of the data channels selected whose (u,v) falls in a given uv cell on the weight density grid. Since the aggregated weights, in any given uv cell, will change depending on the number of channels included when imaging, the psf calculated for a given frequency channel will also necessarily change, resulting in variability in the psf for a given frequency channel when *perchanweightdensity=False*. In general, *perchanweightdensity=False* results in smaller psfs for the same value of robustness compared to *perchanweightdensity=True*, but the rms noise as a function of channel varies and increases toward the edge channels; *perchanweightdensity=True* provides more uniform sensitivity per channel for cubes. This may make it harder to find estimates of continuum when *perchanweightdensity=False*.

The underlying issue with more uniform robust weighting is how the weight density maps onto the uv-grid, which can give high weight to areas of the uv-plane that are not actually more sensitive. The setting *mosweight = True* has long been known as potentially useful in cases where a mosaic has non-uniform sensitivity, but it was found that it is also very important for more uniform values of robust Briggs weighting in the presence of relatively poor uv-coverage. For example, snap-shot ALMA mosaics with *mosweight = False* typically show an increase in noise in the corners or in the areas furthest away from the phase-center.

This means that higher spatial frequencies are weighted down relative to lower spatial frequencies, to suppress artifacts arising from poorely sampled regions near and beyond the maximum spatial frequency in the uv-plane. It is equivalent to smoothing the PSF obtained by other weighting schemes and can be specified either as a Gaussian in uv-space (eg. units of lambda or klambda) or as a Gaussian in the image domain (eg. angular units like arcsec). Because the natural PSF is smoothed out, this tunes the sensitivity of the instrument to scale sizes larger than the angular-resolution of the instrument by increasing the width of the main lobe.

An approximate theoretical sensitivity can be computed as  sqrt( 1/sumwt ). A more accurate calculation requires a different calculation (LINK to some docs from GM on this).   In tclean, facetted imaging will produce one value of sumwt per facet as the normalizations are to be done separately per facet.  Also, for cube imaging, .sumwt will contain one value per image channel and it can be used to visualize the relative weights across the spectrum (and therefore expected image rms).

    "For all options, the \\'pblimit\\' parameter controls regions in the image where PB-correction is actually computed. Regions below the pblimit cannot be normalized and are set to zero. For standard imaging, this refers only to the pb-corrected output image. For *gridder=\\'mosaic\\'* and *\\'awproject\\'* it applies to the residual, restored and pb-corrected images.  A small value (e.g. *pblimit=0.01*) can be used to increase the region of the sky actually imaged. For *gridder=\\'standard\\'*, there is no pb-based normalization during gridding and so the value of this parameter is ignored.The sign of the pblimit parameter is used for a different purpose. If positive, it defines a T/F pixel mask that is attached to the output residual and restored images.  If negative, this T/F pixel mask is not included.  Please note that this pixel mask is different from the deconvolution mask used to control the region where CLEAN based algorithms will search for source peaks.  In order to set a deconvolution mask based on pb level, please use the \\'pbmask\\' parameter.Based on the above, please note that certain values of pblimit to avoid, are 1, -1, and 0. When the pblimit is set to 1 the entire image is masked as the user is specifying that no normalization or deconvolution happens if the PB gain is lower than 1, which leads to the entire image being masked. Setting the pblimit to -1 also results in no deconvolution as mentioned in the case where pblimit is 1 but there is no masking of the image. Finally a pblimit of zero is not feasible but rather a small value such as 1e-6 is used instead to make a really large wide field image.\n",

The minor cycle can give equal weight to all flux components that it finds. At the end of deconvolution, the primary beam must be divided out of the restored image.

Therefore, the minor cycle needs to account for this while searching for flux components (a signal-to-noise dependent CLEAN). This form of normalization is particularly useful for mosaic imaging where the sky brightness can extend across many pointings, or if there is an uneven distribution of weights across pointings. This is because joint mosaics are usually done for sources with spatial scales larger than the field-of-view of each antenna and which are not explicitly present in the measured data. In this situation, allowing the minor cycle to use flux components that span across beams of adjacent pointings is likely to provide a better constraint on the reconstruction of these unmeasured spatial frequencies, and produce smoother large-scale emission.\n",

Within this system, the minor cycle algorithm operates largely in the image domain starting with a PSF and a residual image (i.e. the gradient of chi-square or the right hand side of the normal equations). The output is an incremental model image that defines the \\'step\\' taken during the chi-square minimization process. In the next major cycle, the contribution of this model image is subtracted out of the list of visibilities and the result is regridded and transformed to produce a new residual image. This approach allows for a practical trade-off between the efficiency of operating in the image domain (or simply with gridded visibilities) and the accuracy that comes from returning to the ungridded list of visibilities after every \\'step\\'. It also allows for minor cycle algorithms that have their own internal optimization schemes (i.e. they need not be strict chi-square minimizations) with their own control parameters. Note that any minor cycle algorithm that can operate on gridded visibilities can fit into this framework. The inputs to the minor cycle algorithm are the residual image, psf and perhaps a starting model. Outputs are a model image.\n",

    "\n",
    "The CLEAN algorithm forms the basis for most deconvolution algorithms used in radio interferometry. The peak of the residual image gives the location and strength of a potential point source. The effect of the PSF is removed by subtracting a scaled PSF from the residual image at the location of each point source, and updating the model. Many such iterations of finding peaks and subtracting PSFs form the minor cycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several variants of the CLEAN algorithm. Some operate with a delta function sky model and others with a multi-scale sky model. In all cases, the the sky brightness is parameterized in a sparse basis such that in practice, the minor cycle algorithm needs only to search for the location and amplitude of peaks. This makes it efficient. For example, fields of compact sources are best represented by delta function locations and amplitudes. Extended emission is modeled as a linear combination of components of different scale sizes and transformed into a multi-scale basis where again, delta functions are all that are required to mark the location and amplitude of blobs of different sizes. Multi-term algorithms for wideband imaging model the sky brightness and its spectrum simultaneously, using coefficients of a Taylor polynomial as a sparse representation of a smooth spectrum. In this case, the location of each (multi-scale) component is chosen via a search and the values of the Taylor coefficients for that component are solved for via a direct linear least squares calculation.\n",

    "Hogbom CLEAN [\\[2\\]](#Bibliography) operates with a point-source model of the sky brightness distribution. The minor cycle searches for the location and amplitude of components and then subtracts a scaled and shifted version of the full PSF to update the residual image for each point source. This algorithm is efficient in that delta functions are optimal for fields of compact sources, but susceptible to errors due to inappropriate choices of imaging weights, especially if the PSF has high sidelobes. It uses the full PSF during its update step to ensure that the next residual is as accurate as possible, but this can get compute intensive.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In its original form, the Hogbom algorithm operated just once in the image domain without new residuals being computed via a major cycle. In our CASA Imager implementation, it is treated as a minor cycle where one periodically does major cycles as well (to guard against minor cycle evolution that is not strictly constrained by the ungridded visibilities).\n",

    "Clark CLEAN [\\[3\\]](#Bibliography) also operates only in the image-domain, and uses a point-source model. There are two main differences from the Hogbom algorithm. The first is that it does its residual image updates using only a small patch of the PSF. This is an approximation that will result in a significant speed-up in the minor cycle, but could introduce errors in the image model if there are bright sources spread over a wide field-of-view where the flux estimate at a given location is affected by sidelobes from far-out sources. The second difference is designed to compensate for the above. The iterations are stopped when the brightest peak in the residual image is below the first sidelobe level of the brightest source in the initial residual image and the residual image is re-computed by subtracting the sources and their responses in the gridded Fourier domain (to eliminate aliasing errors). Image domain peak finding and approximate subtractions resume again. These two stages are iterated between until the chosen minor cycle exit criteria are satisfied (to trigger the next true major cycle that operates on ungridded visibilities).\n",
    "\n",
    "Since Clark CLEAN also uses only delta function, it is similar in behavior to Hogbom.

For structure with very bright and sharp edges, a series of nearby scale sizes works best, often in conjunction with a mask. The largest scale size should be less than or equal to the smaller dimension of large scale features. One must also take care to avoid scale sizes that correspond to the unmeasured short spacings in the central region of uv space, as the reconstruction on these scales will see no constraints from the data and can result in arbitrary values (or divergence). For mosaics of extended emission, it is sometimes possible to use large scale sizes in the minor cycle if there are enough connected structures across pointings, but since there still is no actual short spacing uv data to constrain those scales, they should be used with caution. A reasonable starting point for setting the scales (assuming the cell size samples the mainlobe of the psf by a factor of \\~5) is *scales=\\[0,5,15\\]*.\n",

    "\n",
    "In addition to this base normalization, a *smallscalebias* parameter may be used to bias the solution towards smaller or larger scales. This is especially useful when very large scale emission is coupled with weak compact features. The peak from each scale\\'s smoothed residual is multiplied by ( 1 - *smallscalebias* \\* scale/maxscale ) to increase or decrease the amplitude relative to other scales, before the scale with the largest peak is chosen.\n",

    "*smallscalebias=0.0* (default) implies equal weight to all scales (as per the natural normalization that comes with the principal solution). Increasing it from 0.0 to 1.0 biases the reconstruction towards smaller scales in the supplied range. Decreasing it from 0.0 to -1.0 biases it towards larger scales in the supplied range.  It can be useful to experiment with MS-clean in *interactive=True* mode. If you notice that bright regions of emission are overcleaned in the first few major cycles (i.e. negative regions will appear in the residual image), it suggests that too much cleaning is happening on the largest scales and it can help to increase the *smallscalebias*. Additionally, it is often necessary to clean comparatively deeply to reap the full benefit of a multi-scale CLEAN.  Note also that scale bias (*smallscalebias*) is a fine-tuning tool that will be useful only if the list of supplied scale sizes is also appropriate to the structure being deconvolved; before turning to smallscalebias, it is advisable to first ensure that the *scales* parameter is set to reasonable values.\n",

Practical implications of this are a higher than expected rms in the zero-th order image because the higher order terms being fitted have more reconstruction error and are not strictly linearly independent from the zero-th order term. In the outputs of the Multi-Term algorithm, the restored images contain these modified residuals, whereas the residual images contain the unmodified residuals which conform to what astronomers typically mean by \\'residual\\' images.

This is usually seen in deep imaging runs with large numbers of closely-spaced weak sources, and when the PSF has sidelobes above the 0.1 level. The use of masks or clean boxes to constrain the search space alleviates the problem. A PSF with lower sidelobes (for example the PSF from MFS imaging as compared to a single channel PSF) can also prevent this type of flux bias with the CLEAN algorithm and more importantly it does so without having to invoke complicated masking procedures.\n",

For astronomical images this implies well-separated point sources whose properties can be described by single basis functions (one pixel each) and whose central peaks are minimally affected by PSF sidelobes from neighbouring sources. In a crowded field of point sources, especially with a PSF with high sidelobes, the CLEAN algorithm is more error-prone in the low SNR regime.

MEM uses the Bayesian formulation of chi-square minimization, and applies a penalty function based on relative image entropy. This choice of penalty function biases the estimate of the true sky brightness towards a known prior image.

The bottom panels show residual images (gradient of chi-square) which radio astronomers typically use to judge whether all the signal in the data has been modeled or not. These images show how well the different methods handle extended emission. For example, CLEAN results in significant correlated flux in the residuals. MEM does better but the error pattern has significant structure outside the source too. MS-CLEAN has lower residuals than the two previous methods but has a characteristic pattern arising from using a fixed set of scale sizes to model complicated spatial structure. The ASP method shows much more noise-like residuals owing to the fact that at each iteration it finds best-fit components.

    "###### Threshold\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard stopping criterion is a threshold on the peak brightness in the residual image. When artifacts do not dominate the residuals, such a threshold is a robust way of terminating a run. A global stopping threshold is usually related to the theoretically expected rms (typically $5\\sigma$). A stopping threshold to trigger a major cycle is usually related to the height of the strongest sidelobe of the strongest source. The rationale behind this choice is to expect errors in the subtraction of the contributions of flux components during the minor cycle (due to approximations such as the beam patch size) and to prevent spurious new components from being added to the model.\n",

    "###### Niter\n",

    "A simple stopping criterion is the total number of iterations (individual minor cycle steps).

It is usually used as an over-ride for the more natural stopping criteria of thresholding.\n",

    "###### Non-Convergence\n",
    "\n",
    "When the data do not exactly conform to what the algorithm is solving for, true convergence and theoretical noise estimates will not be reached.

You can use the viewer to save a region formatted according to the CRTF specification. To do this, an image must already exist to serve as a reference or template to create the mask image or the region.\n",

The mask has to have the same shape (number of pixels, velocity, and Stokes planes) as the output image. An exception are single velocity and/or single Stokes plane masks. They will be expanded to cover all velocity and/or Stokes planes of the output cube. \n",

The \\\"auto-multithresh\\\" algorithm can be selected via the *usemask* parameter. For this algorithm, the mask will be updated at the beginning of a minor cycle based on the current residual image. The algorithm uses multiple thresholds based on the noise and sidelobe levels in the residual image to determine what emission to mask. It also have functionality to remove (\\\"prune\\\") small mask regions that are unlikely to be real astronomical emission.

This procedure ensures that sources are not masked too tightly, i.e., there is a margin between the emission and the mask.  Note that *smoothfactor* and *cutthreshold* are related.

Th previous total positive mask is expanded (or grown) via an operation known as binary dilation, which expands each mask region using a structuring element (also known as a kernel). Currently the structuring element is fixed with a 3x3 matrix with the diagonal element being 0. We use a constraint mask based on a low signal-to-noise threshold to limit the expansion of the mask to regions within the *lownoisethreshold*.

    "\n",
    "Prior to CASA 5.5, \\\"auto-multithresh\\\" estimated the noise per channel using the median absolute deviation (MAD), scaled to match a Gaussian distribution. This noise estimate is computationally fast, but may be less accurate for cases where the emission covers a large fraction (nominally 50%) of the field of view. In CASA 5.5, a new noise estimate was introduced, which uses a more complex and computationally expensive noise estimate. This estimate may yield more accurate estimates of the noise in the case where emission covers a significant fraction of the field of view. The procedure is as follows. If there is no mask, remove pixels from the noise distribution via Chauvenet\\'s criterion [\\[2\\]](#Bibliography)  [\\[3\\]](#Bibliography) and then estimate the noise using the remaining pixels via the median absolute deviation. If there is a mask, then calculate the noise from the pixels outside the clean mask and inside the primary beam mask, which we refer to as the masked MAD. All MAD values are scaled to match a Gaussian distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The parameter fastnoise is set to True by default. \n",
    "\n",
    "###### Polarization Data\n",
    "\n",
    "As of CASA 5.6, auto-multithresh now functions with polarization data. It applies the same algorithms to the Stokes QUV images as used for the Stokes I image. This means that the full masking process is applied to the positive emission (including the prune and grow steps), but that the masking of the negative emission only includes the initial threshold mask (no prune or grow).\n",
    "\n",
    "###### A Note on Input Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "The default \\\"auto-multithresh\\\" parameters have been optimized for the ALMA 12m array in its more compact configurations. The parameters may need to be modified for other input cases, e.g., ALMA 12m long baseline data, ALMA 7m array data, and  VLA data. The main parameters to explore are *noisethreshold*, *sidelobethreshold*, *lownoisethreshold*, *minbeamfrac*, and *negativethreshold* (if you have absorption). We do not recommend changing the *cutthreshold* and *smoothfactor* parameters from their default values. The *dogrowprune* and *growiterations* parameters are primarily used to improve the speed of the algorithm for large cubes.\n",

    "##### Mapping between Data Channels and Image Channels\n",
    "\n",
    "During the gridding process, the **tclean** task makes a choice about how to map data channels to image channels, based on the channelization encoded in the MS and the user-specified image channelization. The mapping between data channels and imager channels may vary depending on the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  If the user-specified \\'start\\' frequency is not at a data channel boundary, the visibility data and weights are interpolated and then evaluated at the centers of the shifted frequency grid. \n",
    "2.  When image channels are wider than data channels, visibilities and weights are binned and gridded via multi-frequency synthesis (MFS) within each image channel.\n",
    "3.  On-the-fly software Doppler tracking can also be done as a time-dependent frequency relabeling of the data channels, before interpolation and binning choices are made.\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually, a combination of these three operations are performed during gridding. There are also special cases where only some or none of them apply. This behavior is consistent between the old and new Imager code (i.e., **clean** and **tclean**).\n",
    "\n",
    "The *interp* parameter chooses the interpolation scheme to be used during the gridding process. The choices are currently \\'*nearest\\'*, \\'*linear\\'*, and \\'*cubic\\'*.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   *\\'nearest\\' *just picks the value of the nearest data channel.\n",
    "-   \\'*linear*\\' will interpolate the data channel to a channel width that is an integral number of channels that fits in an image channel. For example, if the image channel is 3.14x the width of the original data channel, then interpolation will interpolate the data and weights to 3 channels with a width of 3.14/3.0 times the original width of the data channel.The linear gridder will use the 2 adjacent original data channel to interpolate.\n",
    "-   \\'*cubic*\\' works the same as \\'linear\\', but with the nearest 4 instead of 2 data channels.\n",

    "\n",
    "Traditionally, multi-frequency synthesis (MFS) imaging refers to gridding visibilities from multiple frequency channels onto a single spatial-frequency grid. It assumes that the sky brightness and the primary beam are constant across the total measured bandwidth and all frequencies measure the same visibility function just at different spatial frequencies. In this case, standard imaging and deconvolution algorithms can be used to construct an accurate continuum image.\n",
    "\n",
    "For sources with spectral structure across the observed band, this approach converts any spectral variations of the visibility function into spurious spatial structure that does not follow the standard convolution equation in the image domain and therefore will not self-correct during deconvolution.  For the VLA at L-Band, for example, a 1.0 Jy source with spectral index of -1.0 across the 1-2 GHz band will produce spectral artifacts at the $5\\times10^{-3}$ level. Therefore, sources requiring dynamic ranges (peak brightness / thermal noise) less than a few hundred will not see any of these artifacts and basic MFS imaging will suffice. Detection experiments in otherwise empty fields are a good example of when this method is most appropriate.\n",

    "##### (2) MT-MFS (nterms\\>1)\n",
    "\n",
    "To alleviate the spectral artifacts discussed above and to reconstruct the broad-band sky brightness distribution correctly, a spectral model must be folded into the reconstruction process. The advantages of such an image reconstruction are that the combined $uv$ coverage (from all channels) is used, flux components are \\'tied\\' across frequency by the use of an explicit spectral model or physically motivated constraints, and the angular resolution of the resulting intensity and spectral index images is not limited to that of the lowest frequency in the band. Under high signal-to-noise conditions, the angular resolution follows that of the highest frequency in the band.  Disadvantages are that the reconstruction is often tied to a specific spectral model and will work optimally only for sources whose spectral structure can be described by that model (i.e.a low order Taylor polynomial). In low signal-to-noise situations, the unnecessary fitting of higher order terms can increase the noise and error in the results.\n",

    "The MTMFS algorithm models the spectrum of each flux component by a Taylor series expansion about $\\nu_0$ .$$\\begin{eqnarray} \\vec{I}^{m}_{\\nu} = \\sum_{t=0}^{N_t -1} {w_{\\nu}^{t}} \\vec{I}^{sky}_{t} ~~~\\mathrm{where}~~~ w_{\\nu}^{t}&=&{ \\left( \\frac{\\nu - \\nu_0}{\\nu_0} \\right) }^t  \\end{eqnarray}$$where $I^{sky}_t$ represents a multi-scale Taylor coefficient image,and $N_t$ is the order of the Taylor series expansion.\n",

The relative weights/flags of data on either side of this frequency should be inspected to ensure that the reconstruction is not ill-conditioned. The output intensity image represents the flux at this reference frequency. Please note that the value at a specific reference frequency is different from the integrated flux across a frequency range.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### nterms\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of Taylor coefficients to solve for is a user parameter.  The optimal number of Taylor terms depends on the available signal-to-noise ratio, bandwidth ratio and spectral shape of the source as seen by the telescope (sky spectrum x PB spectrum). In general, *nterms*=2 is a good starting point for wideband EVLA imaging and the lower frequency bands of ALMA (when fractional bandwidth is greater than 10%) if there is at least one bright source for which a dynamic range of greater than few 100 is desired. Spectral artifacts for the VLA often look like spokes radiating out from a bright source (i.e. in the image made with standard mfs imaging).  If increasing the number of terms does not eliminate these artifacts, check the data for inadequate bandpass calibration. If the source is away from the pointing center, consider including wide-field corrections too.\n",
    "\n",
    "The signal-to-noise ratio of the source must also be considered when choosing nterms. Note that the Taylor polynomial is in I vs $\\nu$ space. This means that even for a pure power law, one may need nterms=3 or 4 in order to properly fit the data if there is adequate signal to see more spectral variation than a straight line. One should avoid trying to fit a high-order polynomial to low signal-to-noise data. \n",

    "The basic products of the MT-MFS algorithm are a set of $N+1$ (multi-scale) Taylor coefficient images that describe the spectrum of the sky brightness at each pixel (coefficients of an $N^{th}$-order polynomial). The $0^{th}$-order coefficient image is the Stokes I intensity image at the reference frequency.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Multi-Term Restoration\n",
    "\n",
    "The restoration step of the MT-MFS algorithm performs two actions in addition to the standard convolution of the model with a Gaussian beam and adding back of the residuals. First, it converts the residuals into the Taylor coefficient space before adding them to the smoothed model components (which are already Taylor coefficients). The residuals (or error) will typically be higher for higher order terms. Since the terms are not strictly independent, errors from including higher order terms may slightly increase the noise floor even on the zeroth order intensity image.  This arises because the concept of a \\'residual image\\' is different for a multi-term algorithm. For standard narrow-band imaging, the residual or dirty image already has sky-domain fluxes.  For multi-term imaging, the residual or dirty image must be further processed to calculate Taylor coefficients which represent sky-domain fluxes. It is this step that will provide accurate spectral indices (for example) from undeconvolved dirty images (i.e. tclean runs with niter=0 and deconvolver=\\'mtmfs\\').\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Calculating Spectral Index\n",
    "\n",
    "Spectral index is computed as $I^{sky}_{\\alpha} =  I^m_1 /  I^m_0$, for all pixels above a threshold applied to the $I^m_0$. Other pixels are zeroed out and a mask is applied.  Currently this threshold is automatically calculated to be 5 x max( peak residual, user threshold ).  Right now, the spectral index calculation can be modified  in two ways (a) perform the above division oneself in a python script or (b) use the widebandpbcor task with action=\\'calcalpha\\'.   The ability to control this within tclean itself will be added in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "Spectral curvature (when possible) is also computed from the Taylor coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Calculating Error in Spectral Index\n",
    "\n",
    "An estimate of spectral index error is also provided as an output image. This is an empirical error estimate derived as the result of error propagation through the division of two noisy numbers: alpha = tt1/tt0 where the \\'error\\' on tt1 and tt0 are just the values from the residual coefficient images at each pixel. In the limit of perfect deconvolution and noise-like residuals, this number can be accurate. However, in practice, deconvolution artifacts usually remain in the residual image (especially underneath extended emission) and they dominate the errors. In general, the spectral index error map should only be used as a guide of which regions of the image to trust relative to others, and not to use the absolute value of error for scientific analysis.  A more useful error estimate can be derived by repeating the imaging run (especially if it involves multi-scale components) with slightly different settings of scale sizes and iteration controls, to see what is true signal and what can be attributed to reconstruction uncertainty.  For high signal-to-noise compact sources, error limits of $\\pm 0.05$ can be achieved. For complicated extended emission at about SNR=100 or less, typical errors are about $\\pm 0.2$.  These errors are highly correlated with how appropriately the scale sizes are chosen, with errors ranging from $\\pm 0.1$ or less up to $\\pm 0.5$ in the limit of using delta functions to try to model extended emission.\n",
    "\n",
    "Errors on spectral curvature are much higher than for spectral index. In one example where the M87 galaxy was imaged at L-Band, only the central bright inner lobes (at dynamic range of a few thousand) showed average spectral curvature that could be trusted.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### (3) Cube + imcollapse.\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest form of wideband imaging is to treat each frequency channel independently and make an image cube. A continuum image can then be formed by first smoothing all planes to a common (lowest) angular resolution and computing the mean across frequency. Spectral structure can be modeled per pixel from this smoothed cube. The main advantage of this method is its simplicity and the fact that it does not depend on any particular spectral model. The main disadvantage is that the angular resolution of all higher frequency channels must be degraded to that of the lowest frequency before any combined analysis can be done. Also, in case of complicated spatial structure, each frequency\\'s $uv$ coverage may be insufficient to guarantee reconstructions that are consistent with each other across the band.\n",

The second figure below shows the effective frequency dependence when using conjugate beams duing imaging.  The blue curve is significantly flat compared to the plot in the first figure.

It represents the number of discrete w-values to be used to quantize the range of w-values present in the dataset being imaged. An appropriate value of wprojplanes depends on whether there is a bright source far from the phase center, the desired dynamic range of an image in the presence of a bright far out source, the maximum w-value in the measurements, and the desired trade off between accuracy and computing cost. As a (rough) guide, VLA L-Band D-config may require a value of 128 for a source 30arcmin away from the phase center. A-config may require 1024 or more. To converge to an appropriate value, try starting with 128 and then increasing it if artifacts persist. W-term artifacts (for the VLA) typically look like arc-shaped smears in a synthesis image or a shift in source position between images made at different times. These artifacts are more pronounced the further the source is from the phase center. There is no harm in simply always choosing a large value (say, 1024) but there will be a significant performance cost to doing so, especially for *gridder=\\'awproject\\'* where it is combined with A-Projection. *wprojplanes=-1* may be used with *gridder=\\'widefield\\'* or *\\'wproject\\'* to automatically compute the number of planes.\n",

Next come large pointing offsets (such as beam squint or illumination offsets) and at a higher dynamic ranges ($10^4$ and beyond) are other factors such as the details about feed leg structures. On its own, parallactic angle rotation causes artifacts only at a dynamic range of around $10^5$ but if any of the other large effects (pointing offset or illumination pattern errors) are not azimuthally symmetric, then parallactic angle rotation will have an effect at much lower dynamic ranges.\n",

    "#### Theoretical Description \n",
    "\n",
    "A theoretical description of single-dish image generation and data gridding\n",
    "\n",
    "For single-dish observations, ALMA uses on-the-fly mapping.  The technique is described in Mangum et al. (2007) [\\[1\\]](#Bibliography).\n",
    "\n",
    "Converting single-dish observations into an image or cube is done almost entirely in the image domain. After taking and calibrating the data, the process follows three steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Forming the image grid\n",
    "2.  Populating the image grid\n",
    "3.  Smoothing the image data\n",
    "\n",
    "The fundamental parameter relevant to image quality is the sampling interval. There are a number of sampling functions that need to be considered: the sky sampling function, the image grid sampling function, and the response function of the single-dish beam. These functions all convolve against each other to yield an effective image resolution somewhat poorer than the actual theoretical FWHM of the telescope primary beam.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dimensions and extent of the image grid are determined by the mapped area on the sky. The gridding pixel size must be at least one half the size of the theoretical beam when convolved with the sky-sampling function. Since the sky sampling function is typically 1/3 to 1/5 of the primary beam, and the effective FWHM of the telescope and sky sampling function is close to that of the telescope anyway, it\\'s safe to use a pixel dimension that is 1/3th the width of the primary beam.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a 30\\\" telescope beam with a 6\\\" sky sampling function has an effective FWHM of $\\sim \\sqrt{(30^2+6^2)}\\simeq$ 30.6\\\". Therefore, computing an image pixel size that is 30\\\"/3 = 10\\\", is appropriately oversampling the effective beam FWHM and sampling interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the coordinates of the data are transformed into sky coordinates, the image grid is formed with dimensions either consistent with the user specifications, or so that the image fully encompasses the observed sky positions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For each pixel in the grid (e.g. in RA-Dec space), the gridding process searches through the data for measurements taken within some cutoff radius (specified by *convsupport*). Depending on their distance from the grid coordinate, the observation is weighted according to the *kernel* type and added together in the spatial domain (i.e. entire spectra are added together). If the *clipminmax* function is invoked, the maximum AND minimium data in the ensemble (prior to weighting) are rejected before summing. This process is repeated iteratively for each element in the grid.\n",

    "\n",
    "##### Default operation\n",
    "\n",
    "The **sdimaging** task can determine and populate almost all the gridding parameters by default.  Simply invoking **sdimaging** with the single-dish MeasurementSet and output file name will work. This will produce a single, potentially very large cube having as many channels as necessary to span the entire spectral range, with a spectral resolution equal to that of the observation.\n",

The image dimensions are determined by the spatial extent of the mapped area in the observation, and by default, all channels and all spectral windows are imaged, along with all antennas and all polarizations.\n",

    "##### Customized operation\n",

    "Of course, users can tune their data products by specifying the image size and dimensions, the frequency/velocity characteristics, the gridding and data filtering and smoothing parameters, and so on. The defaults for **sdimaging** for image resolution (i.e. cellsize in arcsec) is determined from the rest frequency of the 0th spectral window so that there are three pixel elements across the beam, the beam being calculated with $b\\times\\frac{\\lambda}{D}$.  See information here about tapering: [PrimaryBeamArcsec](https://safe.nrao.edu/wiki/bin/view/ALMA/PrimaryBeamArcsec). The image extent is computed by default so that the sampled area is completely encompassed in a single rectangle, and the pixel dimension follows naturally from maxsize/cellsize. The default image center (the somewhat inappropriately-named *phasecenter* parameter) is computed simply as the center of that region.\n",

While this may simply be because of deconvolution uncertainty in the ill-constrained INT-only reconstruction, it requires more investigation to evaluate absolute flux correctness.  For example, it will be useful to evaluate if the INT-only reconstructed flux changes significantly with careful hand-masking.\n",

    "[Feathering is a technique used to combine a Single Dish (SD) image with an interferometric image of the same field.The goal of this process is to reconstruct the source emission on all spatial scales, ranging from the small spatial scales measured by the interferometer to the large-scale structure measured by the single dish.  To do this, feather combines the images in Fourier space, weighting them by the spatial frequency response of each image. This technique assumes that the spatial frequencies of the single dish and interferometric data partially overlap. The subject of interferometric and single dish data combination has a long history. See the introduction of Koda et al 2011 (and references therein) [\\[1\\]](#Bibliography) for a concise review, and Vogel et al 1984 [\\[2\\]](#Bibliography), Stanimirovic et al 1999 [\\[3\\]](#Bibliography), Stanimirovic 2002 [\\[4\\]](#Bibliography), Helfer et al 2003 [\\[5\\]](#Bibliography), and Weiss et al 2001 [\\[6\\]](#Bibliography), among other referenced papers, for other methods and discussions concerning the combination of single dish and interferometric data.]The feathering algorithm implemented in CASA is as follows: \n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Regrid the single dish image to match the coordinate system, image shape, and pixel size of the high resolution image.    \n",
    "2.  Transform each image onto uniformly gridded spatial-frequency axes.\n",
    "3.  Scale the Fourier-transformed low-resolution image by the ratio of the volumes of the two \\'clean beams\\' (high-res/low-res) to convert the single dish intensity (in Jy/beam) to that corresponding to the high resolution intensity (in Jy/beam). The volume of the beam is calculated as the volume under a two dimensional Gaussian with peak 1 and major and minor axes of the beam corresponding to the major and minor axes of the Gaussian.    \n",
    "4.  Add the Fourier-transformed data from the  high-resolution image, scaled by $(1-wt)$ where $wt$ is the Fourier transform of the \\'clean beam\\' defined in the low-resolution image, to the scaled low resolution image from step 3.5.  Transform back to the image plane.\n",
    "\n",
    "The input images for feather must have the following characteristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.   Both input images must have a well-defined beam shape for this task to work, which will be a \\'clean beam\\' for interferometric images and a \\'primary-beam\\'  for a single-dish image. The beam for each image should be specified in the image header. If a beam is not defined in the header or feather cannot guess the beam based on the telescope parameter in the header, then you will need to add the beam size to the header using **imhead**.    \n",
    "2.  Both input images must have the same flux density normalization scale. If necessary, the SD image should be converted from temperature units to Jy/beam. Since measuring absolute flux levels is difficult with single dishes, the single dish data is likely to be the one with the most uncertain flux calibration. The SD image flux can be scaled using the parameter *sdfactor* to place it on the same scale as the interferometer data. The casafeather task (see below) can be used to investigate the relative flux scales of the images.*    *\n",
    "\n",
    "[Feather attemps to regrid the single dish image to the interferometric image. Given that the single dish image frequently originates from other data reduction packages, CASA may have trouble performing the necessary regridding steps. If that happens, one may try to regrid the single dish image manually to the interferometric image. CASA has a few tasks to perform individual steps, including **imregrid** for coordinate transformations, **imtrans** to swap and reverse coordinate axes, the tool **ia.adddegaxes()** for adding degenerate axes (e.g. a single Stokes axis). See the \\\"[Image Analysis](imaging.ipynb#image-analysis)\\\" chapter for additional options. If you have trouble changing image projections, you can try ][the [montage package](http://montage.ipac.caltech.edu/), which also has an [associated python wrapper](http://www.astropy.org/montage-wrapper/).]\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are feathering large images together, set the numbers of pixels along the X and Y axes to composite (non-prime) numbers in order to improve the algorithm speed. In general, FFTs work much faster on even and composite numbers. Then use the subimage task or tool to trim the number of pixels to something desirable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The inputs for **feather** are: \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "#feather :: Combine two images using their Fourier transforms\n",
    "imagename       = ''     #Name of output feathered image\n",
    "highres         = ''     #Name of high resolution (interferometer) image\n",
    "lowres          = ''     #Name of low resolution (single dish) image\n",
    "sdfactor        = 1.0    #Scale factor to apply to Single Dish image\n",
    "effdishdiam     = -1.0   #New effective SingleDish diameter to use in m\n",
    "lowpassfiltersd = False  #Filter out the high spatial frequencies of the SD image\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The SD data cube is specified by the *lowres* parameter and the interferometric data cube by the *highres* parameter. The combined, feathered output cube name is given by the *imagename* parameter. The parameter *sdfactor* can be used to scale the flux calibration of the SD cube. The parameter *effdishdiam* can be used to change the weighting of the single dish image.\n",
    "\n",
    "The weighting functions for the data are usually the Fourier transform of the Single Dish beam FFT(PB~SD~) for the Single dish data, and the inverse, 1-FFT(PB~SD~), for the interferometric data. It is possible, however, to change the weighting functions by pretending that the SD is smaller in size via the *effdishdiam* parameter. This tapers the high spatial frequencies of the SD data and adds more weight to the interferometric data. The *lowpassfiltersd* can take out non-physical artifacts at very high spatial frequencies that are often present in SD data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the only inputs are for images; **feather** will attempt to regrid the images to a common shape, i.e. pixel size, pixel numbers, and spectral channels. If you are having issues with the regridding inside feather, you may consider regridding using the **imregrid** and **specsmooth** tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **feather** task does not perform any deconvolution but combines the single dish image with a presumably deconvolved interferometric image. The short spacings of the interferometric image that are extrapolated by the deconvolution process will be those that are down-weighted the most when combined with the single dish data. The single dish image must have a well-defined beam shape and the correct flux units for a model image (Jy/beam instead of Jy/pixel). Use the tasks **imhead** and **immath** first to convert if needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting with a cleaned synthesis image and a low resolution image from a single dish telescope, the following example shows how they can be feathered: \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "feather(imagename ='feather.im',       #Create an image called feather.im\n",
    "        highres   ='synth.im',         #The synthesis image is called synth.im\n",
    "        lowres    ='single_dish.im')   #The SD image is called single_dish.im\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Visual Interface for feather (casafeather) \n",
    "\n",
    "CASA also provides a visual interface to the **feather** task. The interface is run from a command line *outside* CASA by typing casafeather in a shell. An example of the interface is shown below. To start, one needs to specify a high and a low resolution image, typically an interferometric and a single dish map. Note that the single dish map needs to be in units of Jy/beam. The output image name can be specified. The non-deconvolved (dirty) interferometric image can also be specified to use as diagnostic of the relative flux scaling of the single dish and interferometer images. See below for more details. At the top of the display, the parameters *effdshdiameter* and *sdfactor* can be provided in the \"Effective Dish Diameter\" and \"Low Resolution Scale Factor\" input boxes. One you have specified the images and parameters, press the \"Feather\" button in the center of the GUI window to start the feathering process. The feathering process here includes regridding the low resolution image to the high resolution image.\n",

Green is the single dish data (low resolution) and purple the interferometric data (high resolution). To bring them on the same flux scale, the low data were convolved to the high resolution beam and vice versa (selectable in color preferences). In addition, a single dish scaling of 1.2 was applied to adjust calibration differences. The weight functions are shown in yellow (for the low resolution data) and orange (for the high resolution data). The weighting functions were also applied to the green and purple slices. Image slices of the combined, feathered output image are shown in blue. The displays also show the location of the effective dish diameter by the vertical line.

You can also select whether the x-axis for the slices are in the u, or v, or both directions, or, alternatively a radial average in the uv-plane. For data cubes, one can also select a particular velocity plane, or to average the data across all velocity channels. The scatter plot can display any two data sets on the two axes, selected from the \\'Color Preferences\\' menu. The data can be the unmodified, original data, or data that have been convolved with the high or low resolution beams. One can also select to display data that were weighted and scaled by the functions discussed above.\n",

    "\n",
    "Plotting the data as a scatter plot is a useful diagnostic tool for checking for differences in flux scaling between the high and low resolution data sets.The dirty interferometer image contains the actual flux measurements made by the telescope. Therefore, if the single dish scaling is correct, the flux in the dirty image convolved with the low resolution beam and with the appropriate weighting applied should be the same as the flux of the low-resolution data convolved with the high resolution beam once weighted and scaled. If not, the *sdfactor* parameter can be adjusted until they are the same. One may also use the cleaned high resolution image instead of the dirty image, if the latter is not available. However, note that the cleaned high resolution image already contains extrapolations to larger spatial scales that may bias the comparison.\n",

Once the button is released, the zoom rectangle can still be moved or resized by dragging. To complete the zoom, double-click inside the selected rectangle. If you instead double-click outside the rectangle, you will zoom out.\n",
    "-   PANNING (hand icon): Press the panning tool's mouse button on a point you wish to move, drag it to the position where you want it moved, and release. Note: The arrow keys, Page Up, Page Down, Home and End keys can also be used to pan through your data any time you are zoomed in. (Click on the main display area first, to be sure the keyboard is 'focused' there).\n",
    "-   STRETCH-SHIFT COLORMAP FIDDLING (crossed arrows): This is usually the handiest color adjustment; it is assigned to the middle mouse button by default. Hold down the tool\\'s mouse button and drag across the display window to adjust the stretch and color. Note that you can also adjust the color table quantitatively inside the [Data Display Options](#viewerRasterMap) window.\n",
    "-   BRIGHTNESS-CONTRAST COLORMAP FIDDLING (light/dark sun): Another tool to adjust the color stretch.\n",
    "-   POSITIONING (plus): This tool can place a point marker on the display to select a position. It is used to flag MeasurementSet data or to select an image position for spectral profiles. Click on the desired position with the tool's mouse button to place the point; once placed you can drag it to other locations. You can also place multiple points on the display (e.g. for different spectral profile positions) -- remove them by hovering over and hitting ESC. Double-click is not needed for this tool. See [Viewer Region Positioning](#the-region-manager-panel) for more detail.\n",
    "-   RECTANGLE, ELLIPSE, and POLYGON REGION DRAWING: The rectangle region tool is assigned to the right mouse button by default. As with the zoom tool, a rectangle region is generated by dragging with the assigned mouse button; the selection is confirmed by double-clicking within the rectangle. An ellipse regions is created by dragging with the assigned mouse button. In the case of an elliptical region, both the elliptical region and its surrounding rectangle are shown on the display. The selection is confirmed by double-clicking within the ellipse. Polygon regions are created by clicking the assigned mouse button at the desired vertices and then clicking the final location twice to finish. Once created, a polygon can be moved by dragging from inside, or reshaped by dragging the handles at the vertices. See [Viewer Region Positioning](#viewerRegionPositioning) for the uses of this tool.\n",
    "-   POLYLINE DRAWING: A polyline can be created by selecting this tool. It is manipulated similarly to the polygon region tool: create segments by clicking at the desired positions and then double-click to finish the line.\n",
    "-   DISTANCE TOOL (ruler): After selecting the distance tool by assigning a mouse button to it, distances on the image can conveniently be measured by dragging the mouse with the assigned button pressed. The tool measures the distances along the world coordinate axes and along the hypotenuse. If the units in both axes are \\[deg\\], the distances are displayed in \\[arcsec\\].\n",

To save the display panel state, select Save Panel State from the Display Panel drop-down menu or click the \\\"Save Display Panel State to File\\\" icon on the main toolbar (an arrow pointing from a picture to a page, see [Main Toolbar](#the-main-toolbar)). It is advisable but not required to retain the file's \\'.rstr\\' (\\\"Restore\\\") extension.You can restore the display panel to the saved state by loading the saved state from the Data Manager Panel, by selecting Restore Panel State from the Display Panel drop down menu, or by clicking the \\\"Restore Display Panel State\\\" icon (just to the right of the \\\"Save Display Panel State\\\" icon).It is possible to restore panel states viewing MeasurementSets, images, or panel states that have multiple layers, such as contour plots over raster images. You can also save LEL displays. You can also the save or restore the panel state with no data loaded, which is a convenient way to restore preferred initial settings such as overall panel size.Data Locations: The viewer is fairly forgiving regarding data location when restoring a saved panel state. It will find files located:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   in the original location recorded in the restore file\n",
    "-   in the current working directory (where you started the viewer)\n",
    "-   in the restore file's directory\n",
    "-   in the original location relative to the restore file\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that you can generally restore a saved panel state if you move that file together with data files. The exception to this rule is that the process is less forgiving if you save the display of an LEL expression. In this case the files must be in the locations specified in the original LEL expression. If a data file is not found, restore will attempt to proceed but results may not be ideal.Manually Editing Saved Display Panel States: The saved \\\"Restore\\\" files are in ascii (xml) format, and manual edits are possible. However, these files are long and complex. Use caution, and back up restore files before editing. If you make a mistake, the viewer may not even recognize the file as a restore file. It is easier and safer to make changes on the display panel and then save the display panel state again.\n"

    "\n",
    "Additionally, the following data types can be loaded via the Data Manager Panel:slice: a subselection of a data cube can be loaded, the start and end pixel in each spatial, polarization, and spectral dimension can be selected.LEL: Instead of only loading an image from disk, you may ask the viewer to evaluate a 'Lattice Expression Language' (LEL) expression (Â§ [6.1.4](https://casa.nrao.edu/casadocs-devel/docs/cookbook/casa_cookbook007.html#section%3Aanalysis.pars.lattice)). This can be entered in the box provided after you click the \\\"LEL\\\" box. The images used in the LEL expression should have the same coordinates and extents.MeasurementSets: A MeasurementSet can only be displayed as a raster. For MeasurementSets, the load tab offers options for data selection. This will reduce loading and processing times for visibility flagging.Regridding Images on Load: Optionally, you may regrid the velocity axis of an image you wish to load to match the current coordinates grid in the Display Panel. In this case, the viewer will interpolate (using the selected interpolation scheme) the cube on disk to share the same velocity gridding as the loaded coordinates. This can be used, e.g. to overlay contour maps of different spectral lines or to make synchronized movies of multiple cubes. Note that the regridding depends on the rest frequency in the image, which is used to calculate the velocities used in regridding.\n",

    "##### Registered vs. Open Datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "When you load data as described above, it is first opened, and then registered on all existing Display Panels. An open dataset has been prepared in memory from disk. All open datasets will have a tab in the Data Display Options window, whether currently registered or not. When a data set is registered to a Display Panel its coordinates are aligned to the master coordinate image in the panel and it is ready for drawing. If multiple Display Panels are open then a data set may be registered on one Display Panel and not on another. Only those data sets registered on a particular Display Panel show up in its Cursors Panel.Why Register More Than One Image? It is useful to have more than one image registered on a panel if you are displaying a contour image over a raster image (see [Overlay Contours on a Raster Map](#viewerContourOverlay)), to 'blink' between images (see Animators in [Viewer Display Panel](#the-viewer-display-panel)), or to compare images using the Cursors Panel.Unregistering Images: A data set can be registered or unregistered using the Image Manager in the Data drop down menu or the Image Manager icon (third from left). This icon will open the Image Manager window and the checkboxes can be used to register or unregister an image.Closing vs. Unregistering: You can close a data set that is no longer needed using the Close option in the Data drop-down menu, the \\\"Close\\\" icon (fourth from left), or right mouse button \"Close\" selection in the [Image Manager](#image-manager).If you close a dataset, you must reload it from disk (or recreate it if it's an LEL expression, regridded image, moment or something similar) to see it again. If you unregister a dataset, it will draw immediately if you re-register it, with its options as you have previously set them. In general, close unneeded datasets but unregister those that you intend to use again.\n",

    " \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Image Manager\n",
    "\n",
    "The Image Manager is used to define the master coordinate image, the sequence of images (e.g. for blinking), to register and unregister images, close images, change between raster, contour, vector, and marker displays, and to modify the properties of images. The panel can be invoked from the \"Manage Images\" tool, the third icon from the left (two overlapping squares).An example is shown in [Image Manager](#image-manager) figure. In this case, four images are loaded into the viewer. The sequence of images can be changed by dragging and dropping the images to new positions in the stack. The letter to the left indicates whether the image is a Raster, Contour, Vector, or Marker image. MC marks the coordinate master, in this case the second image. The checkboxes are to change the registration statuses. The Coordinate Master image can be defined by a right mouse click, and selecting the corresponding option. The right mouse menu button also offers options for quick changes between contour and raster images and to close an image.The Options button will open a drop-down box (as shown in [Image Manager](#image-manager) for the first image), in which one can again change between image type, change to a different rest frequency (or \"Reset\" to the value in the image header), or open the \\\"Display Options\\\" panel for that specific image with all the adjustment options explained in [Viewing a Raster Map](#viewerRasterMap) or [Viewing a Contour Map](#viewerContourMap)).\n",

    "Structure of CASA images\n",
    "\n",
    "CASA images are stored as tables and can be accessed with CASA tasks and tools. For example, images can be visualized with the CASA **viewer **(see \\'[Image Cube Visualization](imaging.ipynb#image-cube-visualization)\\'), and image metadata can be listed and edited with the **imhead **task. CASA tasks and tools also enable further processing of images, including e.g. the computation of statistics including spectral indices and polarization properties, transformation onto different spatial coordinates, spatial resolutions, and spectral frames, and many other processes (see the following page, '[Dealing with Images](imaging.ipynb#dealing-with-images)' for a description of tasks that operate on CASA images).\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "###### Image Headers\n",
    "\n",
    "Image Headers contain metadata on the observation -- e.g. the observing date, pointing position, object observed, etc., and the resulting image -- e.g. the restoring beam size, image intensity units, spatial coordinate system, spectral parameters, stokes parameters, etc.  Header metadata tells the user what is in the image, and is used by the CASA **viewer** and other tasks to set the data array on the correct spatial and spectral coordinates, assign the intensity values correctly, and otherwise properly handle the data cube. \n",
    "\n",
    "Image Headers can be accessed and edited via the **imhead** task and the **msmd** tool.  Header data can also be inspected with the **casabrowser**.  See the page on \\'[Image Headers](imaging.ipynb#dealing-with-image-headers)\\' for further details. \n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "###### Image Axes / Velocity Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "CASA images typically have the following axis order (python indices are zero-based): Axis 0 = RA, 1 = DEC, 2 = Stokes, 3 = Frequency. The spatial axes can alternately contain GLON/GLAT or other coordinate systems.  The spectral axis of images created in CASA is always in frequency units. In addition, one or more velocity systems can be *added* to relabel the spectral axis. When images are imported into CASA from FITS files rather than generated within CASA itself, the above conventions may not apply. See the page on '[Image Import and Export](imaging.ipynb#image-and-image-value-import-and-export)' for further details on importing and exporting FITS files.\n",
    "\n",
    "The spatial and spectral axes in CASA images can be modified using CASA tasks and tools described in the '[Reformat Images](imaging.ipynb#image-reformatting)' page. \n",

    " \n",
    "\n",
    "###### Image Masks\n",
    "\n",
    "Internal Image Masks are stored as Boolean True/False cubes within the images themselves. There can be multiple masks stored in each data cube and one of them is defined to be the \\'default\\' mask. The default mask is the one visible when the image is displayed, e.g. in the **viewer**, and that is applied for operations on images. All masks have labels, such as mask0 etc. and they can be selected by specifying the image name followed by the mask name, separated by a colon. For example, \\'mask1\\' in \\'image.im\\' is used when specifying the image as \\'image.im:mask1\\'. Available masks can be listed with the task **makemask** which can also assign any mask as the default. The same task can also be used to export masks into separate CASA zero/non-zero cubes and to import such cubes as Boolean masks inside images. In addition, **makemask** enables the creation of masks from [image regions](imaging.ipynb#region-files).  More information on masks is provided on the \\'[Image Masks](imaging.ipynb#image-masks)\\' and \\'[LEL Masks](imaging.ipynb#lel-masks)\\' CASAdocs pages. \n",

    "CASA Regions can be specified through simple lists in LEL (e.g. region = 'box\\[\\[108, 108,\\], \\[148, 148\\]\\]') or through CASA Region Text Format (CRTF) files, which are text files that contain one or more regions with specific shapes (e.g. ellipses and rectangles), sizes, and other properties. These files can be used to specify the region of an image in which to operate, and they can easily be modified by the user or converted to CASA image masks (Boolean data cubes) using the **makemask** task. More information on CRTF files is available on the \\'[Region Files](imaging.ipynb#region-files)\\' page.    \n",

The **imhead **task can be used to confirm the axis specifications in the data cube of interest, and the axes may differ from the above sequence, particularly when using FITS data cubes or CASA images that were converted from FITS files.  In the examples, we assume the above axis order. \n",
    "\n",
    "To obtain statistics across RA and DEC for each velocity channel, the user would run the **imstat** task (**imstat** stands for \\\"image statistics\\\") with \\\"axes = \\[0,1\\]\\\".  To obtain statistics over the spectral axis, one would run imstat with *axes = \\[3\\]*.  \n",

    "\n",
    "The box, chans, and stokes parameters are used to select parts of an image cube for the task to operate on.  If a box is applied, the task will operate only on a specific spatial region (e.g. *box = \\'100,100,200,200\\'* will only operate on pixels in the range (100,100) \\<= (x,y) \\<= (200,200) ). If specific channels are specified through chans, the task will select that segment of the spectral axis (e.g. *chans = \\'30\\~45\\'* will operate on channels 30 through 45).  In the same way, stokes selects specific Stokes parameter axes, as e.g. s*tokes = \\'I\\'*.

The input for the mask parameter may be a conditional statement in LEL string format (e.g. *mask = \\' \\\"ngc5921.im \\> 0.5\\'*, which selects all pixels in that image that have values larger than 0.5 and zeros out all other pixels), or may be a Boolean True/False cube or an Integer zero/non-zero cube. The task will not operate on pixels that are \\\"masked\\\", or zeroed out.  See the \\'[Image Masks](imaging.ipynb#image-masks)\\' page for more detail and examples of usage.  \n",

As an example, if you have a mask in a single spectral channel image that you wish to apply to all spectral channels in a cube, you would \\\"stretch\\\" the mask over all of the channels.

    "As summarized in the [CASA Images](imaging.ipynb#casa-images) page, an image header contains information on the observation -- e.g. the observing date, pointing position, object observed, etc., and the resulting image -- e.g. the restoring beam size, image intensity units, spatial coordinate system, spectral parameters, stokes parameters, etc..  Header metadata can also store notes on the observation and/or calibration and image processing.  The header tells the user what is in the image and is used by the CASA **viewer** and other tasks to set the data array on the correct spatial and spectral coordinates, assign the intensity values correctly, and otherwise properly handle the data cube. \n",
    "\n",
    "FITS image headers can be read in CASA using the **listfits** task, whereas CASA image headers can be read and edited using the **imhead** task.  Additionally, the **imhistory** task can be used to view the history of the image, i.e. what operations or processes have been applied to it. These three tasks are described and demonstrated below.\n",

Alternatively, axes can be specified by their names. E.g., to reorder an image with right ascension, declination, and frequency and reverse the first two, *order=\\[''declination'', ''right ascension'', ''frequency''\\]* will work. The axes names can be found typing **ia.coordsys**.**names**. Minimum match is supported, so that *order=\\[\\'d\\', \\'f\\', \\'r\\'\\]* will produce the same results.Axes can simultaneously be transposed and reversed. To reverse an axis, precede it by a \\'-\\'. For example, *order=\\'-10-32\\'* will reverse the direction of the first and third axis of the input image (the zeroth and second axes in the output image).Example (swap the stokes and spectral axes in an RA-Dec-Stokes-Frequency image):\n",

    "##### Computing the Moments of an Image Cube (**immoments**)\n",
    "\n",
    "For spectral line datasets, the output of the imaging process is an image cube, with a frequency or velocity channel axis in addition to the two sky coordinate axes. This can be most easily thought of as a series of image planes stacked along the spectral dimension. A useful product to compute is to collapse the cube into a moment image by taking a linear combination of the individual planes:\n",

    "for pixel i and channel k in the cube I. There are a number of choices to form the moment-m, usually approximating some polynomial expansion of the intensity distribution over velocity mean or sum, gradient, dispersion, skew, kurtosis, etc. There are other possibilities (other than a weighted sum) for calculating the image, such as median filtering, finding minima or maxima along the spectral axis, or absolute mean deviations. And the axis along which to do these calculations need not be the spectral axis (i.e. do moments along Dec for a RA-Velocity image). We will treat all of these as generalized instances of a \"moment\" map.The **immoments** task will compute basic moment images from a cube. The default inputs are:\n",

Choices are: \\'ra\\', \\'dec\\', \\'lat\\', \\'long\\', \\'spectral\\', or \\'stokes\\'. A standard moment-0 or moment-1 image of a spectral cube would use the default choice 'spectral'. One could make a position-velocity map by setting \\'ra\\' or \\'dec\\'.The *includepix* and *excludepix* parameters are used to set ranges for the inclusion and exclusion of pixels based on values. For example, i*ncludepix=\\[0.05,100.0\\]* will include pixels with values from 50 mJy to 1000 Jy, and *excludepix=\\[100.0,1000.0\\]* will exclude pixels with values from 100 to 1000 Jy.If a single moment is chosen, the outfile specifies the exact name of the output image. If multiple moments are chosen, then outfile will be used as the root of the output filenames, which will get different suffixes for each moment. For image cubes that contain different beam sizes for each plane, **immoments** will smooth all planes to the largest beam size first, then collapse to the desired moment.\n",

    "##### Hints for using **immoments**\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to make an unbiased moment-0 image, do not put in any thresholding using *includepix* or *excludepix*. This is so that the (presumably) zero-mean noise fluctuations in off-line parts of the image cube will cancel out. If you image has large biases, like a pronounced clean bowl due to missing large-scale flux, then your moment-0 image will be biased also. It will be difficult to alleviate this with a threshold, but you can try.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make a usable moment-1 (or higher) image, on the other hand, it is critical to set a reasonable threshold to exclude noise from being added to the moment maps. Something like a few times the rms noise level in the usable planes seems to work (put into *includepix* or *excludepix* as needed). Also use *chans* to ignore channels with bad data.\n",

    "###### Gaussian Multiplets\n",
    "\n",
    "It is possible to fit a number of Gaussians together, as multiplets with restrictions. All restrictions are relative to a reference Gaussian (the zero'th component of each multiplet). *gncomps* specifies the number of Gaussians for each multiplets, and, in fact, a number of these multiplets can be fit simultaneously. *gncomps=\\[2,4,3\\]*, e.g. fits a 2-component Gaussian, a 4-component Gaussian, and a 3-component Gaussian all at once. The initial parameter estimates can be specified with the *gmampest*, *gmcenterest*, and *gmfwhmest* parameters and the estimates are simply listed in the sequence of *gncomps*. E.g. if *gncomps=\\[2,4,3\\]* is specified with multiplet G0 consisting of 2 Gaussians a, b, multiplet G1 of 4 Gaussians c, d, e, f, and multiplet G2 of three Gaussians g, h, i, the parameter list in *gm\\*est* would be like *gm\\*est=\\[a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i\\]*.Restrictions can be specified via the *gmampcon* parameter for the amplitude ratio (non-reference to reference), *gmcentercon* for the offset in pixels (to a reference), and *gmfwhmcon* for the FWHM ratio (non-reference to reference). A value of 0 will not constrain anything. The reference is always the zero'th component in each multiplet, in our example, Gaussians a, c, and g. They cannot be constrained. So *gmncomps=\\[2, 4, 3\\]*, *gmampcon= \\[ 0 , 0.2, 0 , 0.1, 4.5, 0 \\]*, *gcentercon=\\[24.2, 45.6, 92.7, 0 , -22.8, -33.5\\],* and *gfwhmcon=\\' \\'* would constrain Gaussians b relative to a with a 24.2 pixel offset, Gaussian d to c with a amplitude ratio of 0.2 and a 45.6 pixel offset, Gaussian e to c with a offset of 92.7 pixels, etc. Restrictions will overrule any estimates.The parameters *goodamprange*, *goodcenterrange*, and *goodfwhmrange* can be used to limit the range of amplitude, center, and fwhm solutions for all Gaussians.\n",

In this case, one can choose to write none, any or all of the solution and error images for Gaussian/Lorentzian fits via the parameters *amp*, *amperr*, *center*, *centererr*, *fwhm*, and *fwhmerr*. Each Gaussian component will produce a set of images *\\_0, \\_1*, etc. suffixes. Writing analogous images for polynomial coefficients is not yet supported although polynomial fits when *multifit=True* is supported. Best fit coefficients are written to the logger.

    "This task generates the rotation measure image from stokes Q and U measurements at several different frequencies. You are required to specify the name of at least one image with a polarization axis containing stokes Q and U planes and with a frequency axis containing more than two pixels. The frequencies do not have to be equally spaced (i.e. the frequency coordinate can be a tabular coordinate). It will work out the position angle images for you. You may also specify multiple image names, in which case these images will first be concatenated along the spectral axis using **ia.imageconcat**. The requirements are that for all images, the axis order must be the same and the number of pixels along each axis must be identical, except for the spectral axis which may differ in length between images. The spectral axis need not be contiguous from one image to another. See also the i**magepol.fourierrotationmeasure** function for a new Fourier-based approach.Rotation measure algorithms that work robustly are few. The main problem is in trying to account for the $n- \\pi$ ambiguity (see Leahy et al.1986 - Appendix A.1) [\\[1\\]](#Bibliography) and the [MIRIAD manual](http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/sma/miriad/manuals/SMAuguide/smauserhtml/imrm.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "But as in all these algorithms, the basic process is that for each spatial pixel, the position angle vs frequency data is fit to determine the rotation measure and the position angle at zero wavelength (and associated errors). An image containing the number of $n- \\pi$ turns that were added to the data at each spatial pixel and for which the best fit was found can be written. The reduced $\\chi^2$ image for the fits can also be written. Any combination of output images can be written.\n",

    "The parameter *sigma* gives the thermal noise in Stokes Q and U. By default it is determined automatically using the image data. But if it proves to be inaccurate (maybe not many signal-free pixels), it may be specified. This is used for calculating the error in the position angles (via propagation of Gaussian errors).The argument *maxpaerr* specifies the maximum allowable error in the position angle that is acceptable. The default is an infinite value. From the standard propagation of errors, the error in the linearly polarized position angle is determined from the Stokes Q and U images (at each directional pixel for each frequency). If the position angle error for any pixel exceeds the specified value, the position angle at that pixel is omitted from the fit. The process generates an error for the fit and this is used to compute the errors in the output images.\n",

The parameter *rmmax* specifies the maximum absolute RM value that should be solved for. This quite an important parameter. If you leave it at the default, zero, no ambiguity handling will be used. So some a priori information should be supplied; this is the basic problem with rotation measure algorithms.\n",

    "This application fits a power logarithmic polynomial or a logarithmic transformed polynomial to pixel values along a specified axis of an image or images. These functions are most often used for fitting the spectral index and higher order terms of a spectrum. A power logarithmic polynomial has the form\n",

    "\n",
    "Because the logarithm of the ordinate values must be taken before fitting a logarithmic transformed polynomial, all non-positive pixel values are effectively masked for the purposes of fitting. The coefficients of the two forms are equal to each other except that c0 in the second equation is equal to $\\ln(c_0)$ of the first. In the case of fitting a spectral index, which is traditionally represented as $\\alpha$, is equal to $c_1$. In both cases, $D$ is a normalization constant used so that abscissa values are closer to unity when they are sent to the fitter. This generally improves the probability that the fit will converge. This parameter may be specified via the *div* parameter. A value of 0 (the default) indicates that the application should determine a reasonable value for $D$, which is determined via$D = 10^{\\int(\\log10(\\sqrt(\\min(x)*\\max(x)))}$where *min(x)* and *max(x)* are the minimum and maximum abscissa values, respectively.The inputs are:\n",

    "where the cube/image imagename will be convolved with a kernel defined in the *kernel* keyword. Kernels \\'*gauss\\'* and \\'*boxcar\\'* need the major and minor axes sizes as input, the Gaussian kernel smoothing also requires a position angle. By default, the kernel size defines the kernel itself, i.e. the data will be smoothed with this *kernel*. If the *targetres* parameter for Gaussian kernels is set to \\'*True\\'*, major and minor axes will be those from the output resolution, and the kernel will be adjusted for each plane to arrive at the final resolution. The 'commonbeam' kernel is to be used when the beam shape is different as a function of frequency. This option will then smooth all planes to a single beam, defined by the largest beam in the cube. With the \\'*image\\'* kernel, one can specify an image that will serve as the convolution kernel. A scale factor can be applied, which defaults to flux conservation where units are Jy/beam or Jy/beam.km/s. For all other units, like K, the output will be scaled by the inverse of the convolution kernel. e.g., in the extreme case of a flat distribution the values before and after smoothing will be the same.Examples:1) Smoothing with a Gaussian kernel 20\" by 10\"\n",

Region selection can also be carried out through the *region* parameter (see the pages on [Region Files](imaging.ipynb#region-files) and [Region File Format](imaging.ipynb#region-file-format)) and *box* parameter, while image plane selection is controlled by *chans* and *stokes* parameters.\n",

    "The image metadata in the output file is adopted from another image, which can be specified through the *imagemd* parameter. In *imagemd*, input the name of the image from which the metadata should be copied and used for the output image. If left blank, the task may pick any of the input image headers, so it is better to define this parameter. In fact, the image specified in *imagemd* can be any image, even an image that is not part of the calculations in **immath**.\n",

Spectral selection can be achieved by the *chans* parameter (typically axis 3) and Stokes selection with the *stokes* parameter (typically axis 2). These parameters are described below and are a quick way to select sub-images.

Some analysis tasks show an optional *stretch* parameter which is useful, e.g., to expand a single plane mask to an entire cube along the spectral axis.\n",

    "##### Image Mask Handling (**makemask**) \n",
    "\n",
    "**makemask** facilitates the handling of image masks in CASA. As mentioned above, there are two basic mask formats: 1) one or more Boolean masks stored internally in the image file, and 2) images with zero and non-zero image values. **makemask** looks like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "#makemask :: Makes and manipulates image masks\n",
    "mode                =     'list'        #Mask method (list, copy,expand,delete,setdefaultmask)\n",
    "     inpimage       =         ''        #Name of input image.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To distinguish between Boolean internal masks and zero/non-zero images, **makemask** uses the syntax galaxy.image:mask0 for Boolean masks within an image: in this example, the Boolean mask mask0 within the image galaxy.image*.* Without the colon separator, the image itself will be treated as a zero/non-zero mask.*mode=\\'list\\'* lists all the internal Boolean masks that are present in an image. The default masks can be set with *mode=\\'setdefaultmask\\'* and they can be deleted with the *mode=\\'delete\\'*. The default mask is used when an image is displayed in the viewer and is used in all analysis tasks.*mode=\\'copy\\'* lets a user copy a Boolean mask from one image to another image, or to write out the Boolean mask as a zero/non-zero image. The latter format is very useful when different masks are combined or manipulated. All the image analysis tools, in particular **immath** are applicable for such zero/non-zero masks as they act like normal images. **makemask** will always attempt to regrid the input mask to the output image.In addition *mode=\\'copy\\'* can be used to merge masks and also accepts regions. E.g. to create a mask from a CASA region file, the input would look like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "#makemask :: Makes and manipulates image masks\n",
    "mode                =     'copy'        #Mask method (list, copy,expand,delete,setdefaultmask)\n",
    "     inpimage       = 'inputimage.im'   #Name of input image.\n",
    "     inpmask        = 'region.crtf'    #mask(s) to be processed: image masks,T/F internal masks\n",
    "                                        #(Need to include parent image names),regions(for copy mode)\n",
    "     output         = 'imagemask.im'    #Name of output mask (imagename or imagename:internal_maskname)\n",
    "     overwrite      =      False        #overwrite output if exists?\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "*mode=\\'expand\\'* furthermore expands a mask in the spectral domain. It regrids first then stretches the edge channels. E.g. a one plane continuum image would be stretched to all planes of a data cube.\n",

    "##### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "The CASA image analysis module contains an image analysis tool with numerous methods, as well as several higher level tasks. The tasks free users from the burden of resource management, and offer what many consider to be a more user-friendly interface available via the input \\<taskname\\> CASA command. In many cases, image analysis tasks are really just simple wrappers around analogous tool methods (e.g., the **imcollapse** task is just a relatively simple wrapper around the **ia.collapse**() tool method call), although in some cases, such as with the **imregrid** task, the mapping is not as simple, and much more goes on \\\"under the hood\\\" of a task.\n",

    "##### Overview of Image Analysis Tool Functionality\n",
    "\n",
    "At the heart of the image analysis module is the image analysis tool. An image analysis tool provides access to CASA images. Currently only single-precision, floating-point CASA images are supported by all methods in the image analysis tool and complex-valued images are supported by many, but not all, methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "The default, global image analysis tool is named **ia**. New, initially-unattached image analysis tools can be created via\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "my_new_ia = iatool()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Image analysis tools also provide direct (native) access to FITS and Miriad images, although such access is read-only. These foreign formats to CASA format. For optimum processing speed, it is highly recommended to convert foreign formats to CASA images.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that many methods return new image analysis tools that are attached to an image that method has created. Even if one does not intend on using this returned tool, it is important to capture it and run **ia.done**() on it or it will continue to use resources unnecessarily, e.g.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",

    "Regions, which have previously been discussed, are just another form of an OTF pixel mask, and in fact, if one specifies the *region* and *mask* parameters simultaneously, and the associated image also has a default pixel mask, all these three types of pixel masks are just ANDed together to form the pixel mask that is used in the resulting computation. One can even convert a region specification into a persistent pixel mask by specifying the *region* parameter in e.g., the **ia.fromimage**() image analysis tool method. The created image will have a default pixel mask that is a representation of the region specified (if the initial image had a default pixel mask, then that will be ANDed with the region specification to form the default pixel mask of the resulting image).\n",

    "###### Introduction \n",
    "\n",
    "The Lattice Expression Language (LEL) makes it possible to do arithmetic on lattices (in particular on images \\[which are just lattices plus coordinates\\]). An expression can be seen as a lattice (or image) in itself. It can be used in any operation where a normal image is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize, the following functionality is supported:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   The common mathematical, comparison, and relational [operators](imaging.ipynb#lel-expressions).\n",
    "-   An extensive list of mathematical and logical [functions](imaging.ipynb#lel-expressions).\n",
    "-   Mixed [data type](imaging.ipynb#lel-expressions) arithmetic and automatic data type promotion.\n",
    "-   Support of image [masks](imaging.ipynb#lel-masks).\n",
    "-   [Masking](imaging.ipynb#lel-masks) using boolean expressions.\n",
    "-   Handling of [masks](imaging.ipynb#lel-masks) in an expression.\n",
    "-   Support of image [regions](imaging.ipynb#lel-regions).\n",
    "-   Interface from both Python and C++.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first section explains the syntax. The last sections show the interface to LEL using Python or C++. At the end some [examples](imaging.ipynb#lel-examples) are given. If you like, you can go straight to the examples and hopefully immediately be able to do some basic things.\n",
    "\n",
    "LEL operates on lattices, which are a generalization of arrays. As said above a particular type of lattice is an image; they will be used most often. Because lattices can be very large and usually reside on disk, an expression is only evaluated when a chunk of its data is requested. This is similar to reading only the requested chunk of data from a disk file.\n",
    "\n",
    "LEL is quite efficient and can therefore be used well in C++ and Python code. Note however, that it can never be as efficient as carefully constructed C++ code.\n",

    "##### LEL Expressions \n",
    "\n",
    "LEL Expressions in detail\n",
    "\n",
    "\\--CASA Developer\\--\n",
    "\n",
    "A LEL expression can be as simple or as complex as one likes using the standard arithmetic, comparison, and logical operators. Parentheses can be used to group subexpressions. The operands in an expression can be lattices, constants, functions, and condition masks. \n",
    "\n",
    "> $lat1 + 10$\n",
    ">\n",
    "> $lat1 + 2 * max(lat2,1)$\n",
    ">\n",
    "> $amp(lat1, lat2)$\n",
    ">\n",
    "> $lat1 + mean(img[region1])$\n",
    ">\n",
    "> $lat1 + mean(lat2[lat2>5 \\unicode{x20}\\unicode{x20}\\unicode{x26}\\unicode{x26}\\unicode{x20}\\unicode{x20} lat2<10])$\n",
    "\n",
    "The last example shows how a boolean expression can be used to form a mask on a lattice. Only the pixels fulfilling the boolean condition will be used when calculating the mean. In general the result of a LEL expression is a lattice, but it can be a scalar too. If is is a scalar, it will be handled correctly by C++ and Python functions using it as the source in, say, an assignment to another lattice. LEL fully supports masks. In most cases the mask of a subexpression is formed by AND-ing the masks of its operands. It is fully explained in a [later section](imaging.ipynb#lel-masks).\n",
    "\n",
    "LEL supports the following data types:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Bool\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Float - single precision real (which includes integers)\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Double - double precision real\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Complex - single precision complex\n",
    ">\n",
    "> DComplex - double precision complex\n",
    "\n",
    "All these data types can be used for scalars and lattices.LEL will do automatic data type promotion when needed. E.g. when a Double and a Complex are used in an operation, they will be promoted to DComplex. It is also possible to promote explicitly using the conversion functions (FLOAT, DOUBLE, COMPLEX and DCOMPLEX). These functions can also be used to demote a data type (e.g. convert from Double to Float), which can sometimes be useful for better performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Region is a specific data type. It indicates a region of any type (in pixel or world coordinates, relative, fractional). A region can only be applied to a lattice subexpression using operator `[]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Constants\n",
    "\n",
    "Scalar constants of the various data types can be formed as follows (which is similar to Python):\n",
    "\n",
    "-   A Bool constant can be given as True or False.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{=html}\n",
    "<!-- -->\n",
    "```\n",
    "-   A Float constant can be any integer or floating-point number. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "> $3$\n",
    ">\n",
    "> $3.14$\n",
    ">\n",
    "> $3.14e-2$\n",
    "\n",
    "-   A Double constant is a floating-point number using a D for the exponent. One can also use the `DOUBLE` function. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "> $1d2$\n",
    ">\n",
    "> $3.14d-2$\n",
    ">\n",
    "> $double(2)$\n",
    "\n",
    "-   The imaginary part of a Complex or DComplex constant is formed by a Float or Double constant immediately followed by a lowercase i. A full complex constant is formed by adding another constant as the real part. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "> $1.5 + 2i$\n",
    ">\n",
    "> $2i+1.5$ is identical\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that a full complex constant has to be enclosed in parentheses when, say, a multiplication is performed on it. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "> $2 * (1.5+2i)$\n",
    "\n",
    "The functions `pi()` and `e()` should be used to specify the constants pi and e. Note that they form a Double constant, so when using for example pi with a Float lattice, it could make a lot of sense to convert pi to a Float. Otherwise the lattice is converted to a Double, which is time-consuming. However, one may have very valid reasons to convert to Double, e.g. to ensure that the calculations are accurate enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Operators\n",
    "\n",
    "The following operators can be used (with their normal meaning and precedence):\n",
    "\n",
    "> Unary + and -\n",
    "\n",
    "> Can not be used with Bool operands.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Unary !\n",
    "\n",
    "> Logical NOT operator. Can only be used with Bool operands.\n",
    "\n",
    "> For a region it forms the complement.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Binary \\^, \\*, /, %, +, and -\n",
    "\n",
    "> \\% is the modulo operator. E.g. `3%1.4` results in `0.2` and `-10%3` results in `-1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "> \\^ is the power operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "> All operators are left-associative, except \\^ which is right-associative; thus `2`\\^`1`\\^`2` results in `2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Operator % can only be used for real operands, while the others can be used for real and complex operands.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Operator - can also be used for regions. It forms the difference of the left and right operand.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ==, ! =, \\>, \\> =, \\<,  and \\< =\n",
    "\n",
    "> For Bool operands only = = and ! = can be used. A Bool operand cannot be compared with a numeric operand. The comparison operators use the norm for complex values.\n",
    "\n",
    "> && and \\| \\|  && and \\|\\|\n",
    "\n",
    "> Logical AND and OR operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "> These operators can only be used with Bool operands. When used on a region && forms the intersection, while \\| \\| forms the union.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The precedence order is:\n",
    "\n",
    "> \\^\n",
    "\n",
    "> unary `+, -, !``*, /, %`\n",
    "\n",
    "> `+, -` \n",
    "\n",
    "> `= = ,! = , > , > = , < , < =`\n",
    "\n",
    "> `&&`\n",
    "\n",
    "> `| |`\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that \\^ has a higher precedence than the unary operators.`For example, -3`\\^`2` results in `-9`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The operands of these operators can be 2 scalars, 2 lattices, or a lattice and a scalar. When 2 lattices are used, they should in principle conform; i.e. they should have the same shape and coordinates. However, LEL will try if it can extend one lattice to make it conformant with the other. It can do that if both lattices have coordinates and if one lattice is a true subset of the other (thus if one lattice has all the coordinate axes of the other lattice and if those axes have the same length or have length 1). If so, LEL will add missing axes and/or stretch axes with length 1.\n",

    "\n",
    "A boolean mask associated with an image indicates whether a pixel is good (mask value True) or bad (mask value False). If the mask value is bad, then the image pixel is not used for computation (e.g. when finding the mean of the image).\n",
    "\n",
    "An image can have zero (all pixels are good) or more masks. One mask can be designated as the default mask. By default it will be applied to the image (from Python, designation of the default mask is handled by the **ia.maskhandler** method of the Image tool).\n",
    "\n",
    "When using LEL, the basic behaviour is that the default mask is used. However, by qualifying the image name with a suffix string, it is possible to specify that no mask or another mask should be used. The suffix is a colon followed by the word `nomask` or the name of the alternative mask.\n",
    "\n",
    "      myimage.data\n",
    "      myimage.data:nomask\n",
    "      'myimage.data:othermask'\n",
    "\n",
    " The first example uses the default mask (if the image has one). The second example uses no mask (thus all pixels are designated good) and the third example uses mask `othermask`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that if the image name is enclosed in quotes, the mask name should be enclosed too. It means that a colon cannot be part of an image name.\n",
    "\n",
    " It is also possible to use a mask from another image like\n",
    "\n",
    "      myimage.data:nomask[myotherimage::othermask]\n",
    "\n",
    "This syntax is explained in the section describing [regions](imaging.ipynb#lel-regions).\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Lattice Condition Mask\n",
    "\n",
    "We have seen in the previous section that lattices (in this case images) can have an associated mask. These masks are stored with the image - they are persistent.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also possible to create transient masks when a LEL expression is executed (dawn, usually). This is done with the operator `[]` and a boolean expression. For example,\n",
    "\n",
    "      sum( lat1[lat1<5 && lat1>10] )\n",
    "\n",
    "creates a mask for `lat1` indicating that only its elements fulfilling the boolean condition should be taken into account in the `sum` function. Note that the mask is local to that part of the expression. So in the expression\n",
    "\n",
    "      sum( lat1[lat1<5 && lat1>10] ) + sum(lat1)\n",
    "\n",
    "the second `sum` function takes all elements into account. Masking can also be applied to more complex expressions and it is recursive.\n",
    "\n",
    "      (lat1+lat2)[lat3<lat4]\n",
    "      sum( lat1[lat1<5][lat1>10] )\n",
    "      (lat1 + lat2[lat3<lat4]) [lat1<5]\n",
    "\n",
    "The first example applies the mask generated by the `[]` operator to the expression `lat1+lat2`. The second example shows the recursion (which ANDs the masks). It is effectively a (slower) implementation of the first example in this subsection. In the last example, the expression inside the parentheses is only evaluated where the condition `[lat1<5]` is true and the resulting expression has a mask associated with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note that it is possible to select pixels on an axis by means of the function `INDEXIN` (or by the `INDEXi IN` expression) as shown in the previous section about [miscellaneous functions](imaging.ipynb#lel-expressions).\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Mask Handling\n",
    "\n",
    "As explained in the previous subsections, lattices can have a mask. Examples are a [mask](imaging.ipynb#lel-masks) of good pixels in an image, a mask created using a [boolean condition](imaging.ipynb#lel-expressions) and the operator `[]`, or a mask defining a [region](imaging.ipynb#lel-regions) within its bounding box.A pixel is bad when the image has a mask and when the mask value for that pixel is False. Functions like `max` ignore the bad pixels.Note that in a MeasurementSet a False mask value indicates a good visibility. Alas this is a historically grown distinction in radio-astronomy.Image masks are combined and propagated throughout an expression. E.g. when two lattices are added, the mask of the result is formed by and-ing the masks of the two lattices. That is, the resultant mask is True where the mask of lattice one is true AND the mask of lattice 2 is True. Otherwise, the resultant mask is False.In general the mask of a subexpression is formed by and-ing the masks of the operands. This is true for e.g. +, \\*, `atan2`, etc.. However, there are a few special cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   The mask created by `operator[condition]` is formed by and-ing the condition result, the mask of the result, and the mask of the subexpression where the condition is applied to. For example, suppose `lat1` and `lat2` each have a mask. Then in\n",
    "\n",
    "          sum( lat1[lat2<5] )\n",
    "\n",
    "    the `sum` function will only sum those elements for which the mask of `lat1` and `lat2` is valid and for which the condition is true. \n",
    "\n",
    "-   The logical AND operator forms the resultant mask by looking at the result and the masks of the operands. \n",
    "\n",
    "          lat1[lat1<0 && lat2>0]\n",
    "\n",
    "    Let us say both `lat1` and `lat2` have masks. The operand `lat1<0` is true if the mask of `lat1` is true and the operand evaluates to true, otherwise it is false. Apply the same rule to the operand `lat2 > 0`. The AND operator gives true if the left and right operands are both true. If the left operand is false, the right operand is no longer relevant. It is, in fact, 3-valued logic with the values true, false, and undefined. \n",
    "\n",
    "    Thus, the full expression generates a lattice with a mask. The mask is true when the condition in the `[]` operator is true, and false otherwise. The values of the output lattice are only defined where its mask is true. \n",
    "\n",
    "-   The logical OR operator works the same as the AND operator. If an operand has a true value the other operand can be ignored.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   The mask of the result of the `replace` function is a copy of the mask of its first operand. The mask of the second operand is not used at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   The `iif` function has three operands. Depending on the condition, an element from the second or third operand has to be taken. The resultant mask is formed by the mask of the condition and-ed with the appropriate elements from the masks of the second or third operand.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   The `value` function returns the value without a mask, thus it removes the mask from a value. It has the same effect as the `image:nomask` construction discussed above. However, the `value` function is more general, because it can also be applied to a subexpression.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   The `mask` function returns the mask of a value. The returned value is a boolean lattice and has no mask itself. When the value has no mask, it returns a mask consisting of all True values. When applied to an image, it returns its default mask.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following more or less equivalent examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "       value(image1)[mask(image2)]\n",
    "       image1:nomask[mask(image2)]\n",
    "       image1:nomask[image2::mask0]\n",
    "\n",
    "The first two use the default mask of `image2` as the mask for `image1`.The latter uses `mask0` of `image2` as the mask for `image1`. It is equivalent to the first two examples if `mask0` is the default mask of `image2`.It is possible that the entire mask of a subexpression is false. For example, if the mean of such a subexpression is taken, the result is undefined. This is fully supported by LEL, because a scalar value also has a mask associated with it. One can see a masked-off scalar as a lattice with an all false mask. Hence an operation involving an undefined scalar results in an undefined scalar. The following functions act as described below on fully masked-off lattices:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   MEDIAN, MEAN, VARIANCE, STDDEV, AVDEV, MIN, MAX    result in an undefined scalar:\n",
    "-   NELEMENTS, NTRUE, NFALSE, SUM    result in a scalar with value 0.\n",
    "-   ANY    results in a scalar with value F.\n",
    "-   ALL    results in a scalar with value T.\n",
    "-   LENGTH, NDIM    ignore the mask because only the shape of the lattice matters.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should also be aware that if you remove a mask from an image, the values of the image that were previously masked bad may have values that are meaningless.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Mask Storage\n",
    "\n",
    "In many of the expressions we have looked at in the examples, a mask has been generated. What happens to this mask and indeed the values of the expression depends upon the implementation. If for example, the function you are invoking with LEL writes out the result, then both the mask and result will be stored. On the other hand, it is possible to just use LEL expressions but never write out the results to disk. In this case, no data or mask is written to disk. You can read more about this in the [interface](imaging.ipynb#lel-interface) section.\n",

    "\\--CASA Developer\\--\n",
    "\n",
    "A region-of-interest generally specifies a portion of a lattice which you are interested in for some astronomical purpose (e.g. what is the flux density of this source). Quite a rich variety of regions are supported in CASA. There are simple regions like a box or a polygon, and compound regions like unions and intersections. Regions may contain their own \\`\\`region masks\\'\\'. For example, with a 2-d polygon, the region is defined by the vertices, the bounding box and a mask which says whether a pixel inside the bounding box is inside of the polygon or outside of the polygon.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, although masks and regions are used somewhat differently by the user, a mask is really a special kind of region; they are implemented with the same underlying code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like masks, regions can be persistently stored in image. Within Python, regions can be created using the various methods of the rg tool. Regions can also be defined in plain text files (see [Region File Format](imaging.ipynb#region-file-format)).\n",
    "\n",
    "We saw in the previous section how the condition operator `[]` could be used to generate masks with logical expressions. This operator has a further talent. A region of any type can be applied to a lattice with the `[]` operator. You can think of the region as also effectively being a logical expression. The only difference with what we have seen before is that it results in a lattice with the shape of the region\\'s bounding box. If the lattice or the region (as in the polygon above) has a mask, they are and-ed to form the result\\'s mask.\n",
    "\n",
    "All types of regions supported in CASA can be used, thus:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   regions in pixel or world coordinates\n",
    "-   in absolute, relative and/or fractional units\n",
    "-   basic regions box, ellipsoid, and polygon\n",

    "-   extension of a region or group of regions to higher dimensions\n",

    "The documentation in the classes LCRegion, LCSlicer, and WCRegion gives you more information about the various regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this moment a region can not be defined in LEL itself. It is only possible to use regions predefined in an image or another table.\n",
    "\n",
    "A predefined region can be used by specifying its name. There are three ways to specify a region name:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  `tablename::regionname` The region is looked up in the given table (which will usually be an image) in which it is stored.\n",
    "2.  `::regionname` The region is looked up in the last table used in the expression.\n",
    "3.  `regionname` Is usually equivalent to above. However, there is no syntactical difference between the name of a region and a lattice/image. Therefore LEL will first try if the name represents a lattice or image. If not, the name is supposed to be a region name. The prefix `::` in the previous way tells that the name should only be looked up as a region. \n",

    "      myimage.data:nomask[myotherimage::othermask]\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first example region `reg1` is looked up in image `myimage.data`. It is assumed that `reg1` is not the name of an image or lattice. It results in a lattice whose shape is the shape of the bounding box of the region. The mask of the result is the and of the region mask and the lattice mask.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the second example it is stated explicitly that `reg1` is a region by using the :: syntax. The region is looked up in `otherimage`, because that is the last table used in the expression. The result is a lattice with the shape of the bounding box of the region.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the third example the region is looked up in `myimage.data`. Note that the this and the previous example also show that a region can be applied to a subexpression.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the fourth example we have been very cunning. We have taken advantage of the fact that masks are special sorts of regions. We have told the image `myimage.data` not to apply any of its own masks. We have then used the `[]` operator to generate a mask from the mask stored in a different image, `myotherimage`. This effectively applies the mask from one image to another. Apart from copying the mask, this is the only way to do this.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unions, intersections, differences and complements of regions can be generated and stored (in C++ and Python). However, it is also possible to form a union, etc. in LEL itself. However, that can only be done if the regions have the same type (i.e. both in world or in pixel coordinates).The following operators can be used:\n",

    "###### LEL itself will do some optimization:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   As said in the introduction a LEL expression is evaluated in chunks. However, a scalar subexpression is executed only once when getting the first chunk. E.g. in\n",

    "          lat1 + mean(lat2)\n",
    "\n",
    "    the subexpression `mean(lat2)` is executed only once and not over and over again when the user gets chunks. \n",
    "\n",
    "-   Often the exponent 2 is used in the `pow` function (or operator `^`). This is optimized by using multiplication instead of using the system pow function. \n",
    "\n",
    "-   When LEL finds a [masked-off scalar](imaging.ipynb#lel-expressions) in a subexpression, it does not evaluate the other operand. Instead it sets the result immediately to a masked-off scalar. Exceptions are the operators AND and OR and function `iif`, because their masks depend on the operand values.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### The user can optimize by specifying the expression carefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   It is strongly recommended to combine scalars into a subexpression to avoid unnecessary scalar-lattice operations. E.g.\n",
    "\n",
    "          2 * lat1 * pi()\n",
    "\n",
    "    should be written as\n",
    "\n",

Note that the subexpression parentheses are needed in the first case, because multiplications are done from left to right.    In the future LEL will be optimized to shuffle the operands when possible and needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   It is important to be careful with the automatic data type promotion of single precision lattices. Several scalar functions (e.g. pi) produce a double precision value, so using `pi` with a single precision lattice causes the lattice to be promoted to double precision. If accuracy allows it, it is much better to convert `pi` to single precision. E.g. assume `lat1` and `lat2` are single precision lattices.\n",
    "\n",
    "          atan2(lat1,lat2) + pi()/2\n",
    "\n",

    "          atan2(lat1,lat2) + float(pi())/2\n",

    "    avoids that (expensive) data type promotion. \n",

    "\n",
    "-   `POW(U,2) + POW(V,2) < 1000``^``2` is considerably faster than    `SQRT(SQUARE(U) + SQUARE(V)) < 1000`, because it avoids the `SQRT` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   LEL can be used with disk-based lattices and/or memory-based lattices. When used with memory-based lattices it is better to make subexpressions the first operand in another subexpression or a function. E.g.    `lat1*lat2 + lat3`    is better than    `lat3 + lat1*lat2`    The reason is that in the first case no copy needs to be made of the lattice data which already reside in memory. All LEL operators and functions try to reference the data of their latter operands instead of making a copy.    In general this optimization does not apply to LEL expression. However, when using the true [C++ interface](imaging.ipynb#lel-interface) to classes like `LatticeExprNode`, one can easily use memory-based lattices. In that case it can be advantageous to pay attention to this optimization.\n",

So far the expression is only formed, but not evaluated. Evaluation is only done when the expression is used in an operation, e.g. as the source of the copy operation shown below.\n",

    "CARTA is a new visualization software available to general users who wish to try visualizing image products outside the CASA Viewer.\n",
    "\n",
    "CARTA is the *Cube Analysis and Rendering Tool for Astronomy*, a new image visualization and analysis tool designed for the [ALMA](https://www.almaobservatory.org/en/home/), the [VLA](https://science.nrao.edu/facilities/vla), and the [SKA pathfinders](https://www.skatelescope.org/). As the image size increases drastically with modern telescopes in recent years, viewing an image with a local image viewer or with a remote image viewer via the ssh protocol becomes less efficient. The mission of CARTA is to provide usability and scalability for the future by utilizing modern web technologies and computing parallelization.The official CARTA website and download instructions can be found [here](https://cartavis.github.io/).\n",

    "**WARNING: C**ARTA currenly only contains a subset of the functionality that is available in the CASA Viewer. Eventually, CARTA is expected to replace the CASA Viewer as the standard software to visualize ALMA and VLA imaging. However, additional functionality needs to be added to CARTA over the coming cycles before it should be regarded as a replacement for the CASA Viewer.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "Several feature where CARTA v.1.3 is already superior to the CASA Viewer are:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   CARTA shows better performance, especially noticeable when handling large image cubes.\n",
    "-   CARTA launches in a web browser for remote display options.\n",
    "-   CARTA can display Stokes wedges.\n",
    "-   CARTA does not suffer from problems that the CASA Viewer has with properly displaying headers\n",
    "-   CARTA allows users to flexibly modify and safe the layout.\n",
    "-   CARTA supports the HDF5 image format.\n",
