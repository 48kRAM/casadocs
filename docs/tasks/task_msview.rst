   task description
   
   The msview task will display a MeasurementSet in raster form. Many
   display and editing options are available. Executing the
   **msview** task will bring up a display panel window, which can be
   re-sized (see below). 
   
   If no data file was specified, a Load Data window will also
   appear. Click on the desired MeasurementSet and the rendered data
   should appear on the display panel. A Data Display Options window
   will also appear. It has drop-down subsections for related
   options, most of which are self-explanatory. 
   
   The state of the **msview** task, i.e. the loaded data and related
   display options, can be saved in a 'restore' file for later
   use. You can provide the restore filename on the command line
   or select it from the Load Data window.
   
   For more detailed on how to use the msview task, please read the
   dedicated CASADocs chapter on `2-D Visualization and Flagging of
   Visibility Data
   (viewer/msview) <https://casa.nrao.edu/casadocs-devel/stable/calibration-and-visibility-data/data-examination-and-editing/2-d-visualization-of-visibility-data-msview>`__.
