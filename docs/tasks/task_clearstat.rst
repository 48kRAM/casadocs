   task clearstat examples
   
   To run **clearstat**, no parameters need to be specified.
   
    
   
   The basic way to run the task is 
   
   ::
   
      go clearstat()
   
   as this will not change the current task being scrutinized.
   
    
   
   Note that 
   
   ::
   
      clearstat()
   
   will change the current task assignment to **clearstat**, which is
   generally not what is desired.
