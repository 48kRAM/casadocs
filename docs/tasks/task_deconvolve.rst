Description
   **deconvolve** performs minor cycle deconvolution directly on a
   dirty image. No MS is required.

   .. warning:: **ALERT:** **deconvolve** is currently defunct. We plan to
      replace the task with **tclean**code. For the moment use
      **tclean** (although **tclean** requires an MS at this stage),
      or please use**deconvolve** in an older version of CASA
      (v4.7.2 or earlier).
