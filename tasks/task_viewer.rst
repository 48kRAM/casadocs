Description
   Displays images, data cubes and MeasurementSets.

   The **viewer** will display images in raster, contour, vector or
   marker form. Images can be blinked, and movies are available for
   spectral-line image cubes. For MeasurementSets, many display and
   editing options are available.

   The **viewer** can be run by typing viewer within CASA, or
   casaviewer outside of CASA. Executing **viewer** will bring up a
   display panel window, which can be resized. If no data file was
   specified, a Load Data window will also appear. Click on the
   desired data file and choose the display type; the rendered data
   should appear on the display panel. A Data Display Options window
   will also appear. It has drop-down subsections for related
   options, most of which are self-explanatory.

   The loaded data and related display options can be saved in a
   'restore' file for later use. You can provide the restore filename
   on the command line or select it from the Load Data window.
