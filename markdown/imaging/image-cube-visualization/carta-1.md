CARTA: the Cube Analysis and Rendering Tool for Astronomy

CARTA is the Cube Analysis and Rendering Tool for Astronomy, a new image visualization and analysis tool designed for the [ALMA](http://www.almaobservatory.org), the [VLA](https://science.nrao.edu/facilities/vla), and the [SKA pathfinders](https://skatelescope.org/). CARTA is expected to replace the CASA Viewer in the foreseeable future.

CARTA is an external data analysis package that is being developed by the [Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics (ASIAA)](https://www.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw) the [Inter-University Institute for Data Intensive Astronomy (IDIA)](https://idia.ac.za), the [National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO)](https://science.nrao.edu), and the [Department of Physics, University of Alberta](https://www.ualberta.ca/physics)

As the image size increases drastically with modern telescopes in recent years, viewing an image with a local image viewer or with a remote image viewer via the ssh protocol becomes less efficient. The mission of CARTA is to provide usability and scalability for the future by utilizing modern web technologies and computing parallelization.

CARTA currently already has various capabilities in common the CASA Viewer, but development is still ongoing and not yet all features of the CASA Viewer are available in CARTA. Nevertheless, development of CARTA is progressing rapidly, and since development of the CASA Viewer has put on hold in favor of this, we recommend users to try CARTA for those instances where the CASA Viewer is inadequate. These include:

-   efficiently loading large data cubes
-   flexibility in assigning regions for data analysis
-   clean labeling of the axis

We expect this list to grow rapidly with upcoming CARTA releases.
