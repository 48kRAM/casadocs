Introduction to the CASA Viewer

This documentation describes how to use the CASA Viewer to display data. The Viewer can be started as a stand-alone executable or by the **viewer** task inside a CASA shell. It can display both images and MeasurementSets. The task-level access to the Viewer has been split into two tasks: **imview** for images and **msview** for MeasurementSets. These tasks offer improved scriptability, giving command line access to many of the viewer features.

[For help on the image viewer, please see the subpages shown in the tabs to the left. For the Visibility visualization, please see [2-D Visualization and Flagging of Visibility Data](https://casa.nrao.edu/casadocs-devel/stable/calibration-and-visibility-data/data-examination-and-editing/2-d-visualization-of-visibility-data-msview). ]{
