Instructions on how to create a new page inside a chapter of the Plone system

\--CASA Developer\--

To add a new page to the CASA Docs, follow this procedure:

1.  Navigate to the appropriate folder either using the directory (immediately to the left) or by clicking \"Contents\" in the left-side Plone toolbar and proceeding the proper folder.  (You must be in a folder to add a new page.)
2.  Click \"Add new\" in the left sidebar, then click \"Page\".  This will display the page editor.
3.  Insert the page title.
4.  Insert a 1-line summary of the page in the summary section.
5.  If the page is intended for CASA Developers select \"yes\" under CASA Developer.
6.  If the page is intended to be a subpage of another page in this chapter click \"yes\" under CASA subtopic.  (Note that a subpage is indented in the left-side directory and in the folder view.  Aside from these differences, subpages and pages are exactly the same.) 
7.  Enter the contet of the page in the Text section.
8.  To save your changes, make a note of the work you have done in the \"Change Note\" section and click \"Save\" at the bottom of the page.
9.  By default, new pages are created below all other pages in the directory.  If you want to reorganize the folder content, click \"Contents\" in the left side Plone toolbar.  Drag and drop pages into the desired order.
