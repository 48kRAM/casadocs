# CASA Roadmap 

Process for creating and maintaining the CASA Roadmap

\--CASA Developer\--

The CASA road map describes the high-level plan for CASA development over the next 4 to 6 quarters. The road map is written for internal audiences. The road map may be a subset of the group management document described in [DMSD Software Development Processes](https://sharepoint.nrao.edu/pmd/projects/494%20CASA%20Recommendations%20for%20Improvement%20%20Implemen/DMSD%20SW%20Dev%20Processes.aspx). A table such as the one shown in figure 9 of [Recommendations for Improvement](https://sharepoint.nrao.edu/pmd/projects/494%20CASA%20Recommendations%20for%20Improvement%20%20Implemen/DMSD%20SW%20Dev%20Processes.aspx) may be used to communicate the quarterly focus of the CASA team.

# Schedule

To remain relevant and informative, the road map will be updated twice annually, in quarters 2 and 4. The updated roadmap should be made available at or before the time of the official software release.
