# JIRA Work Request Management 

Process for work request management using JIRA

\--CASA Developer\--

# Background

In the fall of 2016 the CASA development group (CDG) migrated to a [new JIRA server](https://open-jira.nrao.edu/) that is integrated with Atlassian software systems [Confluence](https://open-confluence.nrao.edu/), [BitBucket](https://open-bitbucket.nrao.edu/), and [Bamboo](https://open-bamboo.nrao.edu/). This change is motivated by the [recommendations](https://sharepoint.nrao.edu/dms/CASA%20Docs/Miranda%20Recommendations/EMiranda%20Recommendations.pdf) provided by an exernal consultant who studied the CDG in 2015. The Data Management and Software Department (DMSD) has developed a [software development processes document](https://staff.nrao.edu/wiki/bin/view/DMS/DMSDevelopmentProcesses) that describes departmental policies and recommendations for its software teams; this document adopts some of the recommendations applicable across the department. The CDG JIRA processes follow the DMSD processes as much as possible. This document describes these processes.

For a brief description of JIRA issue types see the [JIRA Concepts - Issues](https://open-jira.nrao.edu/secure/ShowConstantsHelp.jspa?decorator=popup#IssueTypes) page. All of the issue types allowed in the CASA project are described in detail in the [DMSD software development processes document](https://staff.nrao.edu/wiki/bin/view/DMS/DMSDevelopmentProcesses). The only exception is the Sub-task issue type, which has been turned on for the CASA project to allow other issues to be broken down into smaller work assignments. The sub-task issue type uses the Feature workflow.

### Note on Features vs. Epics

Features and Epics are described in the DMSD document in sections 7.2 and 7.4, respectively. A Feature has low coordination needs and is a relatively small, compact change. If the implementation requires coordination or will take more than two weeks to develop, the request should be characterized as an Epic. Epics are typically broken down into sub-tasks.

<div class="alert alert-warning">
Bamboo builds:  All appropriately-named branches will be built by the Bamboo CI plan.  However, only tickets that are typed in JIRA as a Feature (with a feature/CAS-XXXX branch) or a Bugfix (with a bugfix/CAS-XXXX branch) will be packaged and tested with the Bamboo Branch plans!

The issue states are described in greater detail in the [DMSD software development processes document](https://staff.nrao.edu/wiki/bin/view/DMS/DMSDevelopmentProcesses).  

Under normal conditions an issue cannot be reopened. The reason for this restriction lies in the way that the JIRA issue workflow is integrated with the revision control system (BitBucket). After development activity, an issue is closed when the branch associated with the issue has been merged back into the master branch. Since there is no way to unmerge a branch, there is likewise no way to un-close a ticket. Rather than re-opening a ticket, you must create a new ticket.  In exceptional circumstances (such as human error) a CASA project administrator can reopen a closed ticket.

<div class="alert alert-info">
**NOTE**:  It is quite easy to link a new ticket to an old, closed ticket.

# Issue Workflows

Each issue type has its own workflow describing the issue states allowed and the allowed transitions between states.  We have attempted, as much as possible, to minimize the number of clicks required to move an issue through the workflow.  The table below describes the workflows for each issue type:

<table><colgroup><col 

When viewing a JIRA ticket, a link is available next to the issue status value, \"View Workflow\". If you click this link you will see a graphical description of the workflow for that issue type. The graphical workflow includes tool-tips that describe each status and transition. For a more detailed discussion of workflows see the [DMSD software development processes document](https://staff.nrao.edu/wiki/bin/view/DMS/DMSDevelopmentProcesses).
