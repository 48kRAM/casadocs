About listsdm

The task **listsdm** summarizes the content of archival data in the format that is used by ALMA and the VLA for visibility data transport and archiving (the [Science Data Model](https://casa.nrao.edu/casadocs-devel/stable/casa-fundamentals/the-science-data-model), known as ASDM for ALMA). The output in the casalog is very similar to that of **listobs**, which reads the metadata after conversion to a MeasurementSet (see next section). **listsdm** therefore does not require the SDM to be filled into an MS. The output of **listsdm** is also returned as a dictionary.
