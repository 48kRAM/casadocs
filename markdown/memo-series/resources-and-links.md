Useful supplementary information relevant to CASA

 

## Tutorials

-   [CASAguides](https://casaguides.nrao.edu/) contains the most comprehensive data reduction tutorials for ALMA (including simulations) and the VLA. Tutorials also exist for other telescopes, such as ATCA, SMA, and CARMA. The [CASAguides](https://casaguides.nrao.edu/) wiki is also a great resource for tips and tricks in using CASA and contains user contributed scripts.

## Workshops

-   [ALMA community days](https://science.nrao.edu/facilities/alma/community1) webpages provide material that was used during workshops
-   The [2018 VLA data reduction workshop](http://www.cvent.com/events/16th-synthesis-imaging-workshop/event-summary-b36e4bc16b574d5d94229f9d885d0eff.aspx) contains course material
